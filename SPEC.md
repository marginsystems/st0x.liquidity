# SPEC.md

System specification for st0x liquidity. Covers architecture, behavior, and
design decisions at a level sufficient to understand the system without
prescribing exact commands or code. For terminology and naming conventions, see
[docs/domain.md](docs/domain.md).

Current supported offchain execution backends are `alpaca-broker-api` and
`dry-run`.

## Background

Early-stage onchain tokenized equity markets typically suffer from poor price
discovery and limited liquidity. Without sufficient market makers, onchain
prices can diverge substantially from traditional equity market prices, creating
a poor user experience and limiting adoption.

## Solution Overview

This specification outlines a minimum viable product (MVP) arbitrage bot that
helps establish price discovery by exploiting discrepancies between onchain
tokenized equities and their traditional market counterparts.

The bot monitors Raindex Orders from a specific owner that continuously offer
tokenized equities at spreads around Pyth oracle prices. When a solver clears
any of these orders, the bot immediately executes an offsetting trade on the
supported brokerage backend (Alpaca Broker API), hedging directional exposure
while capturing the spread differential.

The focus is on getting a functional system live quickly. There are known risks
that will be addressed in future iterations as total value locked (TVL) grows
and the system proves market fit.

## Operational Process and Architecture

### System Components

#### Onchain Infrastructure

- Raindex orderbook with deployed Orders from specific owner using Pyth oracle
  feeds
  - Multiple orders continuously offer to buy/sell different tokenized equities
    at Pyth price ± spread
- Order vaults holding stablecoins and tokenized equities

#### Offchain Infrastructure

- Brokerage account with API access (Alpaca Markets)
- Arbitrage bot monitoring and execution engine
- Basic terminal/logging interface for system overview

#### Bridge Infrastructure

- st0x bridge for offchain ↔ onchain asset movement

### Operational Flow

#### Normal Operation Cycle

1. Orders continuously offer to buy/sell tokenized equities at Pyth price ±
   spread
2. Bot monitors Raindex for clears involving any orders from the arbitrageur's
   owner address
3. Bot records onchain trades and accumulates net position changes per symbol
4. When accumulated net position reaches the configured execution threshold,
   execute the offsetting trade on the selected brokerage, using the sign of the
   net position to determine side (positive = sell to reduce a long, negative =
   buy to cover a short)
5. Bot maintains running inventory of positions across both venues
6. Periodic rebalancing via st0x bridge to normalize inventory levels

#### Note on Fractional Share Handling

- **Alpaca Broker API**: Supports fractional share trading. Production can use
  dollar-value execution thresholds to reduce unhedged exposure while still
  respecting buying-power constraints.
- **Dry run**: Supports fractional arithmetic for simulation and testing.
  Operators may still configure whole-share thresholds when that is useful for
  conservative modeling.

#### Rebalancing Process

##### Alpaca (Automated)

- **Inventory Monitoring**: InventoryView tracks total inventory across venues
  (onchain tokens + offchain shares, onchain USDC + offchain USDC)
- **Imbalance Detection**: When imbalance ratios exceed thresholds (>60% equity
  imbalance, >70% USDC imbalance), trigger automated rebalancing
- **Equity Rebalancing**:
  - Too many tokens onchain: Redeem tokens -> receive shares at Alpaca
  - Too many shares offchain: Mint tokens -> deposit to Raindex vault
- **USDC Rebalancing**:
  - Too much USDC onchain: Bridge via Circle CCTP (Base -> Ethereum) -> deposit
    to Alpaca
  - Too much USDC offchain: Withdraw from Alpaca -> bridge via Circle CCTP
    (Ethereum -> Base) -> deposit to orderbook vault
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All rebalancing operations tracked as events
  (CrossVenueEquityTransfer, CrossVenueCashTransfer)
- **Integration**: Uses Alpaca for share/USDC management, Circle CCTP for
  cross-chain USDC transfers

Automated rebalancing is Alpaca Broker API based.

##### Shared-Inventory Settlement

Rebalancing deposits and withdrawals do not necessarily settle on the Rain
OrderBook directly. The system supports two settlement modes, selected
explicitly per deployment via `inventory_mode` under `[raindex]`:

- **Legacy** (`inventory_mode = "legacy"`): the bot's own EOA owns the Raindex
  vaults and `deposit4`/`withdraw4` settle against the OrderBook itself. No
  distinct inventory contract is in play. This is the pre-migration state.
- **Managed** (`inventory_mode = "managed"`, requires `inventory`): a shared
  `RaindexInventory` (rainlanguage/raindex.governance) owns the vaults. Every
  venue adapter (Bebop hook, univ4 hook) and this bot's own rebalancing path
  settle through it; fills on the pooled vaults surface as
  `OperatorDeposit`/`OperatorWithdraw`. The bot's EOA must hold `OPERATOR_ROLE`
  on the inventory to operate the vaults. A startup preflight verifies the role
  (retrying to absorb RPC lag right after a cutover grant) and fails fast with a
  clear error rather than reverting on the first rebalance; it also revokes any
  stale pre-migration allowance the bot granted the OrderBook directly.

Distinct from the settlement target is `vault_owner`: the on-chain owner every
`vaultBalance2` read, vault-registry entry, and ClearV3/TakeOrderV3 order-owner
fill match is scoped by. It is required and explicit (no fallback). While the
vaults are bot-EOA-owned it is the `[wallet]` address; once the shared-inventory
migration moves the orders/vaults under the inventory contract, `msg.sender` to
Raindex becomes the inventory, so `vault_owner` must be flipped to the
`inventory` address in the same change that switches `inventory_mode` to
`"managed"` and grants the bot `OPERATOR_ROLE`.

#### Dividend Freeze

A dividend (or other corporate action) bumps a tokenized equity's wrapper NAV.
While that NAV is being reconciled the asset is **frozen** so supply cannot be
created or redeemed at a stale ratio. The freeze is a single cross-bot
mechanism: the issuance service rejects new mints, and the liquidity bot's
rebalancing trigger skips frozen assets before starting any rebalancing flow,
querying issuance's per-asset status endpoint each cycle (fails closed — skip
and alert — when issuance is unreachable).

The freeze guard is operator-toggleable via `freeze_check` under `[rebalancing]`
in the plaintext config. `"enabled"` is the fail-closed behavior above.
`"disabled"` leaves the guard unwired so equity rebalancing proceeds without
consulting issuance (fail-open) — an escape hatch for an issuance outage that
would otherwise fail closed every equity cycle. Issuance secrets stay required
regardless, so re-enabling is a plaintext-config change with no secret update.

The freeze is deliberately narrow: it suspends only **supply** operations.

- **Suspended:** new mints (issuance) and new liquidity-initiated rebalancing
  (mints / redemptions / transfers).
- **Not suspended:** in-flight rebalancing flows, redemption detection, on-chain
  secondary-market trading, and **market-making counter-trade hedging**. Hedging
  is a reactive delta-neutraliser of fills that already executed on the standing
  Raindex orders — which the bot does not place or control — so suspending it
  would only strip the offset and leave naked directional exposure. Hedging
  therefore continues through a freeze (see ADR 0008).

Removing or repricing the standing Raindex orders to avoid stale-NAV arbitrage
during the freeze window is order-management work external to this bot, and out
of scope here.

## Bot Implementation Specification

The arbitrage bot will be built in Rust to leverage its performance, safety, and
excellent async ecosystem for handling concurrent trading flows.

### Event Monitoring

#### Raindex Event Monitor

- Continuous HTTP `eth_getLogs` polling over a single transport -- no WebSocket.
  Every `order_fill_poll_interval` seconds the monitor enqueues a backfill range
  covering the blocks since the persisted checkpoint, capped at the configured
  ingestion cutoff block (must be explicitly configured; recommended value:
  `safe`, i.e. `eth_getBlockByNumber("safe")`); the backfill worker fetches the
  `Clear` and `TakeOrder` logs for the arbitrageur's owner address and advances
  the checkpoint only on success. `required_confirmations` governs
  transaction-submission paths only and does not affect fill ingestion. The
  cutoff tag is configured via `ingestion_cutoff` (required field):
  - **`safe` (recommended):** On OP Stack chains like Base, `safe` is the latest
    L2 block whose sequencer batch has been posted to L1 (not yet L1-finalized).
    Cuts hedging lag from ~20 min to ~seconds. Tradeoff: a sufficiently deep L1
    reorg dropping the batch tx could, in principle, invalidate a safe-ingested
    fill. In practice this is extremely rare and far less likely than the
    latency cost of waiting for L1 finality. The bot currently has no reversal
    path if a fill is invalidated; this trades fill-ingestion correctness for
    latency until full reorg handling is implemented. Additionally, when `safe`
    regresses below the checkpoint within the quiet-skew band
    (`SAFE_CUTOFF_QUIET_SKEW` blocks), the checkpoint is left frozen and any
    newly-canonical fills in the reorged range are not ingested -- consistent
    with the no-reversal-path tradeoff; full reorg handling tracked separately
    in the Reorg protection project.
  - **`finalized`:** Uses `eth_getBlockByNumber("finalized")` (Casper FFG). Full
    reorg protection but ~20 min hedging lag on Base. First-class cross-chain
    reorg handling is tracked separately in the Reorg protection project.
- WebSocket `.watch()` filter polling and `eth_subscribe`/`subscribe_logs` are
  deliberately rejected: on a load-balanced RPC, filters live on a single
  backend node so most polls are round-robined to nodes returning `-32601`, and
  push subscriptions are sticky to one node and silently stall. HTTP polling
  with a persisted checkpoint and explicit, durable retries is the chosen
  ingestion path (aligned with the issuance bot).
- Parse events to extract: symbol, quantity, price, direction
- Generate unique identifiers using transaction hash and log index for trade
  tracking (idempotent ingestion -- overlapping ranges dedupe by
  `(tx_hash, log_index)`)

##### InventoryTrade: a third fill source

Alongside `Clear`/`TakeOrder`, the backfill worker also fetches
`OperatorDeposit`/`OperatorWithdraw` logs from the shared `RaindexInventory`
(`managed` inventory mode only; see "Shared-Inventory Settlement" above) for the
same block range and cutoff. Any settlement a venue adapter (Bebop hook, univ4
hook, or a future venue holding `OPERATOR_ROLE`) routes through the inventory
surfaces as one deposit + one withdraw on the same tx -- the vault deltas
themselves are the trade, agnostic to which adapter routed it, so a new venue is
hedged for free without adapter-specific integration work.

Pairing rules:

- `OperatorDeposit`s are bucketed by settlement tx; each `OperatorWithdraw` is
  matched against its same-tx bucket.
- A leg whose `operator` is the bot's own signing wallet is the bot's own
  rebalancing (`deposit4`/`withdraw4`), not a venue fill, and is filtered out
  before pairing.
- `deposit4`/`withdraw4` are independent contract calls with no atomic settle
  entrypoint linking a deposit to its withdraw. A tx with more than one
  `OperatorDeposit` cannot be safely paired, so the whole tx is quarantined
  (fail closed) rather than risk overwriting a real amount and mis-hedging. An
  unpaired leg (a deposit or withdraw with no counterpart in the batch) is
  likewise dropped.
- Both quarantine cases emit no `InventoryTrade` and increment
  `inventory_ambiguous_settlement_total` / `inventory_unpaired_settlement_total`
  (labeled by leg) so a dropped settlement is observable, not silent.
- The manual `process-tx` recovery CLI command supports `InventoryTrade`
  settlements too, using the same pairing rules.

RUNBOOK: the persisted backfill checkpoint predates inventory ingestion, so
resuming from it silently skips any inventory fills mined before this code's
deploy block. On rollout to an already-running deployment, manually rewind the
checkpoint to the inventory deploy block (or run a one-shot backfill over that
range) so pre-deploy inventory fills get ingested.

#### Orchestration

Orchestration is split into two layers:

- **Baton**: Reusable orchestration toolkit crate built on two foundations:
  **apalis** (persistent job queues, scheduled jobs, durable workflows) and
  **task-supervisor** (long-running streaming services with auto-reconnect and
  exponential backoff). Baton provides unified abstractions on top of both: the
  `Job` trait, common worker patterns, and the job taxonomy described below. Any
  service that needs structured concurrency depends on Baton.
- **Conductor**: Service-specific orchestration logic. Uses Baton to wire up the
  specific jobs, services, and startup sequence for the liquidity bot. Tightly
  coupled to the domain it orchestrates for obvious reasons.

All work flows through one of these patterns:

- **Finite jobs** (apalis): Serialized to SQLite, processed by workers in FIFO
  order. Durable across process restarts. Examples: trade accounting, vault
  discovery, rebalancing operations.
- **Long-running streaming services** (task-supervisor): Continuous async tasks
  that tick on a fixed interval (or maintain a connection) and restart with
  exponential backoff on failure. Transient per-tick errors are logged and
  swallowed; the supervisor restarts only on a panic. Example: the DEX order
  fill monitor, which polls `eth_getLogs` and enqueues backfill ranges.
- **Scheduled jobs** (apalis, future): Cron/interval-triggered work replacing
  manual polling loops. Examples: inventory polling, executor maintenance.
- **Lifecycle workflows** (apalis-workflow, future): Durable multi-step
  pipelines where each step is a checkpoint. Sequential or DAG-based.

The apalis Monitor and task-supervisor together provide unified lifecycle
management: restart policies, graceful shutdown, and event observability.

##### Startup Sequencing

Startup has explicit dependency phases with parallelism where possible:

```mermaid
graph LR
    connect_http --> get_cutoff_block
    setup_cqrs --> get_cutoff_block
    setup_cqrs --> seed_vaults
    setup_cqrs --> setup_rebalancing
    setup_apalis_tables --> backfill
    get_cutoff_block --> backfill
    seed_vaults --> start_runtime
    setup_rebalancing --> start_runtime
    backfill --> start_runtime
```

The trade accounting worker starts only after the initial backfill completes,
guaranteeing historical events are processed in order. Because ingestion is a
checkpoint-driven `eth_getLogs` poll rather than a live subscription, no events
can be missed across downtime: the order fill monitor always resumes from the
persisted checkpoint and re-scans any gap.

Historical backfill resumes from a persisted database checkpoint. The configured
`deployment_block` is only the initial seed for the first startup or for an
empty checkpoint; after a successful backfill, the service records the last
processed block and the next startup begins at the following block. The
checkpoint is updated only after the full backfill range succeeds, so a partial
failure cannot skip unprocessed history.

Completed apalis jobs are operational queue records, not audit history. The
runtime periodically deletes terminal job rows and vacuums SQLite at the
configured `apalis_finished_job_cleanup_interval_secs` cadence so the durable
queue cannot grow without bound during normal operation or repeated restarts.
The cadence must be explicitly configured and non-zero.

Supervised apalis workers isolate terminal failures with a local recovering
circuit. The middleware and durable queue share a four-attempt limit, so a job
produces one terminal transition after exhausting its bounded retries and
remains visible as a terminal Jobs row. The first consecutive terminal failure
then pauses only that worker, sends an operator alert, and records a structured
circuit transition with the worker name, error, failure count, and cooldown. The
process and sibling workers remain live. After a five-minute cooldown, the same
worker resumes without a process restart and records a structured recovery
transition. A successful job resets the consecutive-failure count. Best-effort
workers retain and log terminal jobs without pausing.

Deployed systemd services must use bounded restart loops with a restart delay
long enough to avoid runaway RPC consumption. After the restart limit is hit,
the service stays stopped until an operator investigates.

##### Future: Lifecycle Workflows

Business processes with multiple steps will be modeled as durable workflows via
apalis-workflow. Each step is a checkpoint -- if the process crashes
mid-workflow, it resumes at the last completed step. This is particularly
valuable for the trade lifecycle where a crash between acknowledging an onchain
fill and placing the offchain hedge represents real financial exposure.

### Trade Execution

#### Broker API Integration

The bot supports multiple brokers through a unified trait interface:

##### Alpaca Broker API

- API key-based authentication
- Market order execution for automated hedging
- Manual CLI limit orders for operator intervention
- Manual Alpaca limit orders use day time-in-force only and can optionally be
  marked as extended-hours eligible when the asset supports it
- Order status polling and updates
- Support for both paper trading and live trading environments
- Position querying for inventory management
- Account balance monitoring for available capital

#### Extended-Hours Counter-Trading

By default, automated counter-trades execute as market orders during regular
market hours (9:30–16:00 ET). Onchain fills that arrive in pre-market (4:00–9:30
ET) or after-hours (16:00–20:00 ET) would otherwise leave directional exposure
unhedged until the next regular open — potentially hours of unmanaged delta.
When enabled, the bot hedges immediately during extended sessions using limit
orders, and converges any unfilled extended-hours orders back to market orders
at the regular open.

This behavior is **opt-in per asset** via the required
`extended_hours_counter_trading` field on each `[assets.equities.SYMBOL]` config
block (committed as `"disabled"`). With it disabled for an asset, behavior for
that asset is unchanged: market orders during regular hours only. Assets absent
from the config are treated as disabled (fail-closed). The cancel-and-replace
pass at the regular open honors the same per-asset setting: only orders for
enabled assets are converged.

##### Market session model

Execution decisions are driven by a `MarketSession` classification derived from
the broker calendar:

- **Regular** — standard hours; counter-trades place market orders.
- **Extended** — pre-market or after-hours; the broker accepts only limit orders
  flagged `extended_hours = true`. Counter-trades place a limit order priced
  from the latest trade price plus a configured slippage buffer
  (`counter_trade_slippage_bps`). Rounding favors fill probability (buys round
  up, sells round down) and honors the broker's minimum price variance (penny
  increments at or above $1.00, sub-penny below).
- **Closed** — outside all sessions (overnight, weekends, holidays); no order is
  placed. The exposure is left for the next scan to hedge once the venue
  reopens, rather than failing a durable job against a multi-hour closure.

**External contract (Alpaca).** The session windows (pre-market 04:00–09:30 ET,
after-hours 16:00–20:00 ET), the extended-hours order constraints (only `limit`
orders with `time_in_force` of `day` or `gtc` and `extended_hours = true` are
accepted; market orders are rejected during extended hours), and the minimum
price variance (limit prices at or above $1.00 must be in $0.01 increments — two
decimal places — and below $1.00 may go to $0.0001 — four decimals — with a
sub-penny increment rejected at submission, error code `42210000`) are all
specified by Alpaca's order documentation:
<https://docs.alpaca.markets/us/docs/orders-at-alpaca>. The regular
`open`/`close` edges are read from Alpaca's `/v1/calendar`; the extended
`session_open`/ `session_close` edges are also read from the calendar but
cross-checked against the documented 04:00/20:00 window (a mismatch is logged),
since Alpaca's reference does not formally define those two fields.

The session is re-checked at execution time, immediately before placement, so a
hedge job that was enqueued in one session but runs after a 9:30/16:00 boundary
places the order type appropriate to the _current_ session, not the stale
enqueue-time one.

##### Cancel-and-replace at the regular open

Extended-hours limit orders may not fill before regular hours begin. Every
position scan during Regular hours requests cancellation of any still-live
extended-hours limit order so it is replaced with a market order on a subsequent
scan. The pass is level-triggered rather than keyed to the observed session
transition -- orders already cancelling or terminal are skipped, making the
sweep idempotent -- so an order that straddles the 9:30 boundary, survives a
restart, or whose cancellation request transiently failed is still converged.
Cancellation is two-phase: the order is reconciled against broker state _before_
the cancel is issued (so a fill that landed between the last poll and the cancel
is recorded, never dropped), then moves to a `Cancelling` state and becomes
terminal only once the broker confirms. The owning position is finalized —
applying any partial fill and releasing the pending reference so the symbol can
resume hedging — once the cancellation confirms.

##### Order lifecycle and integrity guarantees

- Orders carry a broker-side `client_order_id` idempotency key so a retry after
  a lost placement response is deduped by the broker rather than
  double-submitted.
- Broker `PartiallyFilled` status is preserved through the executor boundary
  (cumulative fills are not collapsed into `Submitted`), and broker-confirmed
  `Cancelled` is represented distinctly from `Failed`.
- Partial fills are reconciled both by the status-poll loop and immediately
  before any cancellation, so a fill is never lost when an order transitions to
  a terminal state.

#### Idempotency Controls

- Event queue table to track all events with unique (transaction_hash,
  log_index) keys prevents duplicate processing
- Check event queue before processing any event to prevent duplicates
- Onchain trades are recorded immediately upon event processing
- Position accumulation happens in dedicated accumulators table per symbol
- Broker executions track status ('PENDING', 'SUBMITTED', 'FILLED', 'FAILED')
  with broker type field for multi-broker support
- Complete audit trail maintained linking individual trades to batch executions
- Proper error handling and structured error logging

### Trade Tracking and Reporting

#### SQLite Trade Database

The bot uses a SQLite database. State and audit history are stored as CQRS event
streams (see DDD/CQRS/ES Architecture below). The schema is defined across all
migration files in `migrations/`.

- Store each onchain trade with symbol, amount, direction, and price
- Track offchain order lifecycle through CQRS events
- Accumulate net position per symbol until execution thresholds are reached
- Maintain complete audit trail in the immutable event store
- Handle concurrent trade processing safely with per-symbol locking

#### Pyth Price Extraction

- Records the Pyth oracle reference price for a trade via a historic `eth_call`
  to `getPriceUnsafe(feed_id)` on the Base Pyth contract, pinned at the trade's
  block. The service makes no `debug_*`/trace RPC calls.
- The feed ID per equity is configured (optional `pyth_feed_id` under
  `[assets.equities.<SYMBOL>]`). A symbol with no configured feed is recorded
  without enrichment (logged at `debug`); hedging is unaffected.
- Retrieves price value, confidence interval, exponent, and publish timestamp;
  prices are stored in the `onchain_trade_view` alongside trade records
- NULL price values indicate enrichment was skipped (no configured feed, missing
  block number, RPC error, or invalid publish timestamp)
- Because `getPriceUnsafe` reads the feed's stored state as of the trade block,
  the recorded price is an end-of-block reference: it matches what the order
  observed unless a Pyth update for that feed landed in the same block after the
  trade. This is acceptable for analytics and never gates hedging.
- The feed an order reads can change (oracle migrations); `pyth_feed_id` holds
  the current feed per symbol and is refreshed if the order migrates.
- Trade processing continues normally even if price enrichment is skipped

#### Reporting and Analysis

- Calculate profit/loss for each trade pair using actual executed amounts
- Generate running totals and performance reports over time
- Track inventory positions across both venues
- Push aggregated metrics to external logging system using structured logging
- Identify unprofitable trades for strategy optimization
- Separate reporting process reads from SQLite database for analysis without
  impacting trading performance

### Health Monitoring and Logging

- System uptime and connectivity status using structured logging
- API rate limiting and error tracking with metrics collection
- Position drift alerts and rebalancing triggers
- Latency monitoring for trade execution timing
- Configuration management with environment variables and config files
- Proper error propagation and custom error types

### Performance Observability

The dashboard exposes a Performance tab measuring the _technological_ health of
the system (latency and reliability), complementing the P&L tab's economic view.
The hedge-latency metrics are maintained by a forward-only reactor that
subscribes to live CQRS events and writes into bespoke read-model tables
(`hedge_fill`, `hedge_cycle`, `hedge_submission`, and
`hedge_attribution_reset`). That read model reflects activity since deployment
only -- there is no historical backfill from pre-existing events in the event
store. The USDC/equity stage-timing and lifecycle-failure reactors maintain
their own bespoke tables with startup catch-up from the event store.

All four bespoke reactors are idempotent, database-only units and retry
transient SQLite busy/locked failures with bounded exponential backoff. A retry
re-runs the complete event reaction: multi-statement reactions therefore execute
in one transaction, and every insert is conflict-safe under redelivery. No new
write paths touch the trading path.

#### Hedge latency pipeline

Each onchain fill flows through a measurable pipeline. Metric definitions:

- **Detection latency** (per onchain fill): block timestamp of the fill to the
  moment the bot observes it (`PositionEvent::OnChainOrderFilled.seen_at` minus
  `block_timestamp`). High detection latency masquerades as inventory leaks
  during operations. All pipeline latency metrics clamp at zero: freshly mined
  blocks can carry timestamps slightly ahead of the bot's wall clock, and NTP
  corrections can invert adjacent timestamps, so negative latencies are floored
  to zero rather than corrupting percentile aggregations.
- **Decision latency** (per hedge order): observation of the fill that crossed
  the execution threshold to hedge placement (`OffChainOrderPlaced.placed_at`
  minus the latest covered fill's `seen_at`).
- **Submission latency** (per hedge order): hedge placement to broker acceptance
  (`OffchainOrderEvent::Submitted.submitted_at` minus `placed_at`).
- **Execution latency** (per hedge order): broker acceptance to broker fill
  (`Filled.filled_at` minus `submitted_at`).
- **Total exposure window** (per hedge order): earliest covered fill's block
  timestamp to broker fill. This is the headline metric: the period during which
  the system carries unhedged delta, where technical latency becomes financial
  risk.

Because hedges trigger on execution thresholds, a single hedge order may cover
several accumulated onchain fills. Attribution folds each Position aggregate's
event stream in sequence order: fills accumulate as _uncovered_ until an
`OffChainOrderPlaced` event consumes the batch. The batch stays parked with the
in-flight order until it reaches a terminal state: a failed hedge returns its
fills to the uncovered pool, so the retry that eventually closes the risk
inherits the attribution (and its exposure window spans back to the original
fill). Fills not covered by any in-flight or completed hedge constitute the
_open exposure_ (reported with the oldest fill's age). Completed hedges use the
broker's own fill timestamp (from the Position stream) rather than the bot's
reconciliation time, so execution latency excludes polling delay. A manual
position adjustment resets attribution, since accumulated fills no longer drive
hedging decisions.

#### Roundtrip and reliability metrics

- **USDC rebalance stage timing**: per-stage durations of USDC rebalances
  (withdrawal, CCTP burn -> attestation -> mint, deposit, conversion) derived
  from `UsdcRebalanceEvent` timestamps, including attestation-time trends. Shown
  on its own dashboard chart, clearly labeled as USDC-specific.
- **Equity rebalance stage timing**: per-stage durations of equity mints
  (acceptance, token receipt, wrap, vault deposit) and redemptions (vault
  withdraw, unwrap, send, detection, completion), derived from
  `TokenizedEquityMintEvent`/`EquityRedemptionEvent` timestamps and combined
  into one dashboard chart (mint and redemption rows share the chart, each
  labeled by kind), separate from the USDC chart above.
- **Reliability**: error/warning counts by severity, module, and time bucket
  from the structured log store; lifecycle failure events (failed hedges, failed
  rebalance stages, rejections) as an impact-weighted category; job queue health
  (failures, retry distribution, oldest pending age).

Phase 2 adds instrumentation for signals not yet captured: chain tip vs backfill
checkpoint (block lag), poll-cycle duration and skipped ticks, and RPC/broker
API latency, persisted in a lightweight telemetry store outside the event store.
An unavailable ingestion cutoff is recorded as unknown rather than synthesized
as block zero. Its block lag is therefore absent, and the dashboard surfaces the
latest unknown-cutoff sample as degraded instead of reporting a healthy zero
lag.

### Risk Management

- Manual override capabilities for emergency situations with proper
  authentication
- Graceful shutdown handling to complete in-flight trades before stopping
- Per-asset market enable/disable: individual equity markets can be disabled via
  the `enabled` flag in the equity config. Disabled assets accumulate position
  changes but do not trigger counter-trades or rebalancing operations. When
  re-enabled (`enabled = true`), the system resumes both executing accumulated
  counter-trade positions and evaluating rebalancing triggers for any resulting
  inventory imbalances (same semantics as market close/open behavior)

### Infrastructure and Deployment

This section specifies infrastructure, deployment, and secrets management.

Alternative approaches (Ansible, Kamal) were evaluated and documented in commit
`5ede2d47465d3621b351c73c9c1af33d20a7c879`.

#### Tools

- **Terraform**: Provisions DigitalOcean infrastructure (droplet, volume,
  reserved IP). Standard HCL, version pinned via flake.lock. Droplet boots
  Ubuntu; nixos-anywhere converts it to NixOS.

- **nixos-anywhere** + **disko**: One-time bootstrap that installs NixOS on the
  Ubuntu droplet over SSH. Uses kexec to boot a NixOS installer in RAM,
  partitions the disk via disko, and runs nixos-install with the flake's NixOS
  configuration. After bootstrap, deploy-rs manages all updates.

- **deploy-rs**: Deploys to NixOS hosts via SSH. Two activation types:
  `activate.nixos` for full system configuration (SSH, firewall, systemd units,
  Grafana, ragenix), `activate.custom` for standalone service binaries. Includes
  auto-rollback on failed deployments ("magic rollback" reverts if SSH is lost
  during activation).

- (r)**agenix**: Age-encrypted secrets for NixOS, using existing SSH keys. CLI
  encrypts secrets locally into `.age` files you commit to git. NixOS module
  decrypts at activation using the host's SSH key, mounting secrets to
  `/run/agenix/` (tmpfs - cleartext never hits disk or Nix store). No GPG, no
  separate secret distribution - secrets deploy with `nixos-rebuild` like any
  other config. Ragenix is a Rust drop-in for agenix but is less documented, so
  it's best to follow agenix documentation but use ragenix instead.

#### Architecture

Terraform provisions infrastructure (droplet, volume, reserved IP) with an
Ubuntu image. nixos-anywhere bootstraps NixOS on the droplet (one-time).
deploy-rs handles all subsequent system and application deployment over SSH.

_System configuration_ (deploy-rs `activate.nixos`):

- OS essentials: SSH, firewall, users
- Systemd unit definitions for application services (pointing to deploy-rs
  profile paths)
- Grafana as a NixOS native service
- ragenix integration for secret decryption
- Nix configuration (flakes, garbage collection)

_Per-service profiles_ (deploy-rs `activate.custom`, deployed independently):

The set of deployed profiles is declared as a registry in `services.nix`. Each
entry has a `kind` discriminating how it is activated and whether it has a
systemd unit:

- `st0x-hedge` (kind = `st0x`) - hedging bot binary. Full pipeline: decrypts
  agenix secret, installs plaintext config, runs `validate-config`, chowns data
  files, writes git-rev marker, touches readiness marker, restarts unit.
- `dashboard` (kind = `static`) - frontend assets served by nginx; the deploy
  step is `systemctl reload nginx` and there is no managed systemd unit.
- `datasette` (kind = `plain`) - read-only SQLite explorer over the hedge DB.
  Has a systemd unit but no secrets/config; activation just touches the
  readiness marker and restarts. Bound to `127.0.0.1`; access via SSH tunnel.

Activation order within `profilesOrder` is set explicitly by each entry's
`order` field, so adding a new service forces declaring its slot rather than
inheriting an alphabetical attribute order.

Each profile is independently deployable and rollback-able without affecting
others. Units use a `/run/st0x/<name>.ready` marker file gated by
`ConditionPathExists` so they only start after the per-service profile has
finished activation, never on a bare `nixos-rebuild switch`.

_Configuration management_:

- Plaintext config per `st0x`-kind service (`config/*.toml`) baked into Nix
  closure
- Encrypted secrets per `st0x`-kind service (`secret/*.toml.age`) decrypted at
  activation to `/run/agenix/`
- `st0x`-kind binaries use `--config` + `--secrets` flags; `plain`-kind units
  invoke their package binary with declared `args`

_Infrastructure_:

- Terraform (standard HCL) provisions droplet with Ubuntu image
- nixos-anywhere converts Ubuntu to NixOS (one-time bootstrap)
- Nix wraps Terraform for reproducible, version-pinned execution
- Terraform state encrypted with age and committed to git

#### Rollback

deploy-rs deploys each service to a nix profile. Each deployment creates a new
profile generation that can be rolled back to. deploy-rs uses legacy
(`nix-env`-style) profiles internally, not the new Nix CLI profiles. Old
generations are cleaned up by the NixOS garbage collector on a configured
schedule.

#### CI/CD Credential Management

| Secret Type | Storage               | When Used           | Example           |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| Runtime     | ragenix (.age in git) | Decrypted at deploy | Alpaca API keys   |
| Build-time  | GitHub Secrets        | CI build/deploy     | DO token, SSH key |

Use GitHub Actions environment protection (require approval for production,
restrict to master branch).

#### SSH Key Management

All SSH keys centralized in `keys.nix` with role-based access:

- `roles.ssh` — keys authorized for root SSH (operator + CI)
- `roles.infra` — keys that can decrypt terraform state
- `roles.service` — keys that can decrypt service config secrets

`os.nix` imports `roles.ssh` for `authorizedKeys`. CI uses its key (stored as
`SSH_KEY` GitHub secret) for both deployment and terraform state decryption.

### Wallet Management

All onchain write operations use the `Wallet` trait abstraction from the
`st0x-evm` crate. Two wallet backends are available, gated by cargo features on
the `st0x-evm` crate and configured via the `[rebalancing.wallet]` TOML section
(`type = "turnkey"` or `type = "private-key"`):

- **Turnkey** (`turnkey` feature): Signs via Turnkey's AWS Nitro secure enclaves
  for low-latency production signing (50-100ms).
- **Raw private key** (`local-signer` feature): Signs locally with a raw private
  key. Also used in development and testing.

The main crate forwards these as `wallet-turnkey` and `wallet-private-key`
features. Domain logic is decoupled from the signing backend. See
[crates/evm/](crates/evm/) for implementation details.

## Crate Architecture

The codebase is organized into multiple Rust crates to achieve:

1. **Faster builds** - Cargo parallelizes across crates; unchanged crates skip
   rebuild entirely
2. **Stricter abstraction boundaries** - Crate visibility (`pub(crate)`)
   enforces domain isolation at compile-time
3. **Tighter dependency graph** - Dependencies explicit in Cargo.toml, no cycles
   allowed
4. **Reduced coupling** - Each crate defines a clear public API; internals stay
   hidden

### Core Capabilities

The system provides two top-level capabilities:

1. **Hedging** - Offsetting directional exposure by executing trades on
   brokerages
2. **Maintaining balance invariants** - Keeping inventory balanced across venues
   through transfers (tokenization, bridging, vault operations)

### Crate Descriptions

**Integration Layer** (external API wrappers):

| Crate               | Purpose                                                                        | Feature Flags                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `st0x-execution`    | Brokerage API integration for trade execution; Alpaca wallet ops; Pyth feeds   | `alpaca-broker`, `mock`           |
| `st0x-tokenization` | Tokenization API for minting/redeeming equity tokens                           | `alpaca`                          |
| `st0x-bridge`       | Cross-chain asset transfers                                                    | `cctp`                            |
| `st0x-raindex`      | Rain orderbook vault deposit/withdraw operations                               | `rain`                            |
| `st0x-evm`          | EVM chain interaction, wallet abstraction, ABI bindings, chain/token constants | `turnkey`, `local-signer`, `mock` |
| `st0x-wrapper`      | ERC-4626 wrap/unwrap operations and ratio math                                 |                                   |

Each integration crate defines a trait (e.g., `Executor`, `Tokenizer`, `Bridge`,
`Raindex`, `Wallet`, `Wrapper`) with one or more implementations selectable via
feature flags. This allows swapping implementations without changing domain
logic.

**Shared Metadata Layer** (caches consumed by domain and application crates):

| Crate           | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `st0x-registry` | Symbol metadata cache and vault registry, sourced from chain + config |

`st0x-registry` is the only crate that both domain and application crates may
consume to resolve symbols and vault addresses. It does not contain business
rules; it caches reference data.

**Domain Logic Layer** (business rules):

| Crate            | Purpose                                                  | Dependencies                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `st0x-hedge`     | Hedging logic: accumulator, position tracking, queue     | `st0x-execution`, `st0x-registry`                                  |
| `st0x-rebalance` | Balance maintenance: triggers, managers, CQRS aggregates | `st0x-tokenization`, `st0x-bridge`, `st0x-raindex`, `st0x-wrapper` |

Domain crates depend on integration traits, not concrete implementations. This
enables testing with mocks and future implementation swaps. **Domain crates must
be config-agnostic**: they accept narrow constructor arguments (`&dyn Wallet`,
`&dyn Executor`, vault addresses, RPC URLs, threshold values), never `Ctx` or
`BrokerCtx` from `st0x-config`.

**Application Layer** (binaries and wiring):

| Crate            | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `st0x-config`    | TOML/secrets loading, `Ctx`/`BrokerCtx`/`Env` assembly, `setup_tracing`. **Restricted visibility: only `st0x-server` and `st0x-cli` may depend on it. No integration, shared, or domain crate may import it.**        |
| `st0x-server`    | Main bot binary, conductor, wires hedging + rebalancing, API endpoints                                                                                                                                                |
| `st0x-dashboard` | Admin dashboard backend, websocket events, manual operations                                                                                                                                                          |
| `st0x-cli`       | Operator binary; thin wrapper exposing manual operations (orders, equity/USDC transfers, vault deposit/withdraw, CCTP bridging, wrap/unwrap, Alpaca wallet ops, view rebuilds) over the integration and domain crates |

The binary crates wire the layers above into a runnable artifact: `st0x-server`
runs the bot, `st0x-dashboard` exposes the admin UI, `st0x-cli` exposes the same
domain capabilities to a human operator. A command added to the CLI corresponds
to a feature already implemented in an integration or domain crate -- the CLI
does not contain business rules.

### Feature Flag Strategy

Feature flags control which implementations are compiled:

```toml
# Production equities bot
[dependencies]
st0x-server = { features = ["all-wallets"] }

# Dry-run testing
st0x-server = { features = ["mock"] }

# Future: crypto + perps fork with different integrations
st0x-server = { features = ["perp-exchange", "other-bridge", "other-vault"] }
```

This enables:

- Compile-time selection of integrations (no unused code in binary)
- Easy addition of new implementations behind new feature flags
- Fork-friendly architecture for different asset classes

## System Risks

The following risks are known for v1 but will not be addressed in the initial
implementation. Solutions will be developed in later iterations.

### Offchain Risks

- **Threshold-Induced Exposure**: Any configured batching threshold can create
  temporary unhedged exposure while the bot waits to execute the next offchain
  hedge. Fractional support reduces this risk, but buying-power constraints,
  market conditions, and operator-selected thresholds can still delay execution.
- **Missed Trade Execution**: The bot fails to execute offsetting trades on the
  selected brokerage when onchain trades occur, creating unhedged exposure. For
  example:
  - Bot downtime while onchain order remains active
  - Bot detects onchain trade but fails to execute offchain trade
  - Broker API failures or rate limiting during critical periods
- **After-Hours Trading Gap**: Pyth oracle may continue operating when
  traditional markets are closed, allowing onchain trades while broker markets
  are unavailable. Creates guaranteed daily exposure windows.

### Onchain Risks

- **Stale Pyth Oracle Data**: If the oracle becomes stale, the order won't trade
  onchain, resulting in missed arbitrage opportunities. However, this is
  preferable to the alternative scenario where trades execute onchain but the
  bot cannot make offsetting offchain trades.
- **Solver fails:** if the solver fails, again onchain trades won't happen but
  as above this is simply opportunity cost.

## DDD/CQRS/ES Architecture

The system uses Domain-Driven Design with CQRS and Event Sourcing. Audit state
is derived from retained immutable event streams; compactable observational
state may use snapshots as the durable source for pre-compaction history.

- **Complete audit history**: Every retained state change is a fact with
  timestamp and sequence
- **Reproducible audit state**: Replay retained facts to rebuild any audit view
- **Temporal queries**: "What was the position at any point in time?"
- **Zero-downtime projections**: Add new views by replaying existing events
- **Testable business logic**: Given-When-Then tests validate rules without
  database
- **Type-safe state machines**: Invalid transitions become compilation errors

### Architecture

- **Event Store**: Immutable append-only log for retained event streams
- **Snapshots**: Performance optimization for aggregate reconstruction
- **Views**: Materialized projections optimized for queries

Financial audit aggregates retain every event indefinitely. Compaction is
allowed only by the compaction eligibility policy below.

#### Compaction Eligibility Policy

An aggregate may opt into event compaction only when all of these are true:

- The aggregate type is explicitly allowed by this spec.
- The aggregate records observational state fetched from external systems, not a
  financial operation initiated by the bot.
- Historical events older than the latest aggregate snapshot are not needed for
  audit, regulatory review, reconciliation, or projection rebuilds.
- The aggregate can be reconstructed from the `snapshots` table plus newer
  events, or it has a documented external/snapshot-aware rebuild path.
- Enabling compaction is reviewed in the PR that sets
  `COMPACTION_POLICY = CompactAfterSnapshot` for that aggregate.

Eligible aggregate types:

- `InventorySnapshot`: enabled for compaction.
- `VaultRegistry`: eligible only if a future PR also provides a snapshot-aware
  projection rebuild path.

All other aggregates retain events unless this section is updated first.

**Grafana Dashboard Strategy**: Views use SQLite generated columns to expose
JSON fields as queryable columns. Specialized views can pre-compute complex
metrics, simplifying dashboard queries.

### Core Architecture

#### Event Sourcing Pattern

All audit-relevant state changes are captured as immutable domain events. The
event store is the immutable append-only source of truth for retained event
streams. Views and snapshots are derived from retained event streams;
observational aggregates may use snapshots as the durable source for compacted
pre-snapshot history only when allowed by the compaction eligibility policy.

##### Invariant: read models rebuild from the event log

The event store is the **ultimate source of truth**. Every read model is a pure,
deterministic function of the retained event streams and MUST be reconstructable
by replaying them. This holds for cqrs-es materialized views **and** for
reactor-maintained read models (e.g. the rebalance stage-timing table): each
fold must depend only on event payloads -- never on processing-time wall-clock,
nor on which events a live subscriber happened to observe -- so that replaying
the log reproduces byte-identical state (replay-equals-live). No read model may
hold state that cannot be rebuilt from events.

A reactor-maintained read model that satisfies this invariant is therefore not
"best-effort until someone rebuilds it". It catches up from a persisted
per-stream checkpoint at startup (replaying only events past the checkpoint, so
a restart never re-folds the whole history) and can be fully rebuilt on demand
(truncate + replay). A dropped live event, table drift, or even a dropped table
is then recoverable from the event log, never permanent. A new read model must
provide this replay path -- startup catch-up plus a full rebuild -- before the
system relies on it.

The rebalance stage-timing table provides this path today. The hedge-latency
table does not yet: it is still forward-only/best-effort and must gain the same
startup catch-up plus full rebuild before it can claim this invariant.

```

#### Database Schema

The source of truth for all table schemas is the `migrations/` directory.

**Event store** (managed by event-sorcery): `events`, `snapshots`.

**CQRS projection views**: `position_view`, `offchain_order_view`,
`onchain_trade_view`, `usdc_rebalance_view`, `vault_registry_view`,
`equity_redemption_view`. Some views use SQLite generated columns to expose JSON
fields as queryable columns for Grafana dashboards.

### Architecture Decision: Position as Aggregate

In DDD, entities are objects defined by their identity and continuity rather
than their attributes - they have a lifecycle and change over time while
maintaining the same identity. Aggregates are entities that enforce business
rules and maintain consistency boundaries.

OnChain trades, offchain orders, and positions are all entities with distinct
lifecycles, so we model them as separate aggregates:

- **OnChainTrade**: Lifecycle = blockchain fill -> enriched with metadata.
  Immutable blockchain facts (reorgs not currently handled, see Future
  Consideration section).
- **OffchainOrder**: Lifecycle = placed -> submitted -> filled/failed. Broker
  order tracking.
- **Position**: Lifecycle = accumulates fills -> triggers hedging decisions.
  Uses configurable threshold (shares or dollar value) to determine when to
  place offsetting broker orders.

This means blockchain fills are recorded in both OnChainTradeEvent::Filled
(audit trail) and PositionEvent::OnChainOrderFilled (position tracking), but
they serve different purposes in different bounded contexts.

### Aggregate Design

#### EventSourced Trait

Domain types implement the `EventSourced` trait, which provides a safer, more
ergonomic interface than a raw `Aggregate` trait:

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait EventSourced {
    type Id: Display + FromStr + Send + Sync;
    type Event: DomainEvent + Eq;
    type Command: Send + Sync;
    type Error: DomainError;
    type Services: Send + Sync;

    const AGGREGATE_TYPE: &'static str;
    const PROJECTION: Option<Table>;
    const SCHEMA_VERSION: u64;

    // Event-side: reconstruct state from event log
    fn originate(event: &Self::Event) -> Option<Self>;
    fn evolve(entity: &Self, event: &Self::Event)
        -> Result<Option<Self>, Self::Error>;

    // Command-side: process commands to produce events
    async fn initialize(
        command: Self::Command,
        services: &Self::Services,
    ) -> Result<Vec<Self::Event>, Self::Error>;
    async fn transition(
        &self,
        command: Self::Command,
        services: &Self::Services,
    ) -> Result<Vec<Self::Event>, Self::Error>;
}
```

##### Why This Exists

A raw `Aggregate` trait has sharp edges that cause production bugs:

- **Infallible `apply`**: Financial applications cannot panic on arithmetic
  overflow, but `Aggregate::apply` returns nothing
- **Stringly-typed IDs**: `store.execute("some-id", cmd)` takes `&str`, making
  it trivial to pass the wrong ID
- **No schema versioning**: Stale snapshots and views cause silent corruption
- **Flat command handling**: A single `handle` receives all commands regardless
  of lifecycle state

`EventSourced` fixes these by splitting command handling into `initialize` (no
`&self`, impossible to reference nonexistent state) and `transition` (receives
`&self` as the domain type, not `Lifecycle`). Event application is split into
`originate` (genesis events) and `evolve` (subsequent events with fallible
return).

##### Lifecycle Wrapper (Implementation Detail)

`Lifecycle<Entity>` bridges `EventSourced` to the persistence layer via a
blanket `Aggregate` impl. It is an implementation detail -- domain modules never
interact with `Lifecycle` directly:

```rust
enum Lifecycle<Entity: EventSourced> {
    Uninitialized,
    Live(Entity),
    Failed {
        error: LifecycleError<Entity>,
        last_valid_entity: Option<Box<Entity>>,
    },
}
```

- `Uninitialized` -> `Live`: via `originate`
- `Live` -> `Live`: via `evolve`
- Any -> `Failed`: on domain errors (no panics in financial apps)

The error type is derived from `EventSourced::Error`, not a separate type
parameter. Use `Never` (uninhabited type) for aggregates with infallible
operations.

##### Store (Type-Safe Command Dispatch)

`Store<Entity>` enforces typed IDs for command dispatch:

```rust
let positions: Store<Position> = /* built by StoreBuilder */;
positions.send(&symbol, PositionCommand::AcknowledgeFill { .. }).await?;
```

This prevents the class of bugs where string aggregate IDs are mixed up between
different entity types.

#### OnChainTrade Aggregate

**Purpose**: Represents a single filled order from the blockchain. Decouples
trade recording from position management, allowing metadata enrichment without
affecting position calculations.

**Aggregate ID**: `"{tx_hash}:{log_index}"` (e.g., "0x123...abc:5")

**Type**: `OnChainTrade` (implements `EventSourced` with `Error = Never`)

##### State

```rust
struct OnChainTrade {
    symbol: Symbol,
    amount: Decimal,
    direction: Direction,
    price_usdc: Decimal,
    block_number: u64,
    block_timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    filled_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    enrichment: Option<Enrichment>,
}

struct Enrichment {
    gas_used: u64,
    pyth_price: PythPrice,
    enriched_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

##### Commands

```rust
enum OnChainTradeCommand {
    Witness {
        symbol: Symbol,
        amount: Decimal,
        direction: Direction,
        price_usdc: Decimal,
        block_number: u64,
        block_timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
    Enrich {
        gas_used: u64,
        pyth_price: PythPrice,
    },
}
```

##### Events

```rust
enum OnChainTradeEvent {
    Filled {
        symbol: Symbol,
        amount: Decimal,
        direction: Direction,
        price_usdc: Decimal,
        block_number: u64,
        block_timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
        filled_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
    Enriched {
        gas_used: u64,
        pyth_price: PythPrice,
        enriched_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
}
```

**Business Rules** (enforced in `handle()`):

- Can only enrich once
- Cannot enrich before fill is witnessed

#### Position Aggregate

**Purpose**: Manages accumulated position for a single symbol, tracking
fractional shares and coordinating offchain hedging when thresholds are reached.

**Aggregate ID**: `symbol` (e.g., "AAPL")

**Type**: `Position` (implements `EventSourced` with `Error = ArithmeticError`)

##### State

```rust
struct Position {
    symbol: Symbol,
    net: FractionalShares,
    accumulated_long: FractionalShares,
    accumulated_short: FractionalShares,
    pending_execution_id: Option<ExecutionId>,
    threshold: ExecutionThreshold,
    last_price_usdc: Option<Float>,  // Last known USDC price per share; drives
                                     // dollar-threshold hedging. None until a
                                     // priced fill or manual adjustment sets it.
    last_updated: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}

enum ExecutionThreshold {
    Shares(FractionalShares),  // Whole-share style threshold
    DollarValue(Usdc),         // Dollar-value threshold
}
```

##### Commands

```rust
// Common types

    tx_hash: TxHash,
    log_index: u64,
}

    },
}
```

    },
}

enum TriggerReason {
    SharesThreshold {
        net_position_shares: Decimal,
        threshold_shares: Decimal,
    },
    DollarThreshold {
        net_position_shares: Decimal,
        dollar_value: Decimal,
        price_usdc: Decimal,
        threshold_dollars: Decimal,
    },
}
```

**Business Rules** (enforced in `handle()`):

- `AcknowledgeOnChainFill` serves as the genesis event (initializes the
  aggregate on first fill)
- `ManuallyAdjustPosition` is an audited operator repair command that sets the
  absolute net exposure after manual trading or rebalancing outside the bot. It
  may initialize a missing position, including a zero target, using the
  configured execution threshold.
- Manual position adjustment is rejected while an offchain hedge order is
  pending; operators must fail or resolve the pending order first.
- Manual position adjustment changes only `net`, not accumulated long/short
  trading volume, because it corrects exposure rather than rewriting fill
  history.
- Manual position adjustment is optimistically concurrency-checked: when
  `expected_net` is supplied (the CLI always supplies the net it read), the
  command is rejected with `ManualAdjustmentStateChanged` if the live aggregate
  net no longer matches, so a concurrent onchain fill cannot be silently erased.
- A nonzero target under a dollar-value threshold requires a price: the operator
  must supply `price_usdc` (CLI `--price`) unless the position already has a
  known `last_price_usdc`. Otherwise the command is rejected with
  `ManualAdjustmentRequiresPrice`, preventing a repaired exposure that can never
  be valued and would therefore never hedge. The supplied price is persisted as
  `last_price_usdc`. A zero target needs no price.
- Can only place offchain order when threshold is met:
  - **Shares threshold**: `|net_position| >= threshold` (e.g., whole-share
    threshold)
  - **Dollar threshold**: `|net_position * price_usdc| >= threshold` (e.g.,
    $1.00 minimum trade value)
- Direction of offchain order must be opposite to accumulated position (positive
  net = sell, negative net = buy)
- Cannot have multiple pending executions for same symbol
- OnChain fills are always applied (blockchain facts are immutable)
- Threshold is passed as a parameter to commands that need it

#### OffchainOrder Aggregate

**Purpose**: Manages the lifecycle of a single broker order, tracking
submission, filling, and settlement.

**Aggregate ID**: `OffchainOrderId` (UUID)

**Type**: `OffchainOrder` (implements `EventSourced` with `Error = Never`)

##### States

```rust
enum OffchainOrder {
    Pending {
        symbol: Symbol,
        shares: FractionalShares,
        direction: Direction,

### Rebalancing Aggregates

**Note**: Automated rebalancing is Alpaca Broker API based.

#### Cross-Venue Asset Transfer Model

The system operates across two trading venues: **Alpaca** (offchain brokerage
for hedging) and **Raindex** (onchain orderbook for market making). Rebalancing
is fundamentally about transferring inventory between these venues. The transfer
steps differ by asset type and direction, but the core abstraction is the same:
move assets from one venue to the other.

##### Architecture: Three Layers

**Top layer -- Inventory management**: Decides _when_ and _how much_ to transfer
based on inventory imbalances. Tracks in-flight transfers. Does not know _how_
transfers work.

**Middle layer -- Transfer jobs**: Abstracts the _how_. Each of the four
directional transfers is a persisted apalis job whose payload carries the
lifecycle aggregate id (generated at enqueue time), so apalis retries and bot
restarts re-enter the same aggregate. The job's worker calls a resume entry
point on the transfer struct, which loads the aggregate and dispatches on its
current state: an absent aggregate starts a fresh transfer, an in-flight one
resumes from its persisted step, and a terminal one is a no-op. New transfers
and mid-flight resumes share the same entry point -- that uniformity is what
makes recovery dispatch fall out of the standard transfer lifecycle.

Four transfer jobs exist:

| Job                          | Asset  | Steps                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TransferEquityToMarketMaking | Equity | Mint via Alpaca ITN, wrap, deposit to Raindex vault            |
| TransferEquityToHedging      | Equity | Withdraw from Raindex vault, unwrap, redeem via Alpaca ITN     |
| TransferUsdcToMarketMaking   | USDC   | Convert USD->USDC, withdraw, bridge via CCTP, deposit to vault |
| TransferUsdcToHedging        | USDC   | Withdraw from vault, bridge via CCTP, deposit USDC to Alpaca   |

Equity-transfer workers dead-letter a job that exhausts its retries: the Jobs
row is recorded as terminal and retained as the durable ownership record, while
the worker and conductor continue processing unrelated jobs. On startup, any
equity-transfer row owns recovery of its aggregate: a non-terminal row is
requeued, while a terminal row remains dead-lettered instead of being
resurrected through generic tokenization recovery. A poison mint or redemption
row therefore cannot put the bot into a process restart loop.

The trigger enqueues at most one transfer per scope at a time, guarded both by
an in-memory in-progress set and by a Jobs-table dedupe (the in-memory guard
resets on restart; a non-terminal job row suppresses a duplicate enqueue). The
equity dedupe is per-symbol and direction-independent; the USDC dedupe is global
and direction-independent.

**Bottom layer -- Lifecycle aggregates**: Event-sourced entities that track
multi-step transfer progress. These are implementation details of their
respective transfer structs, not top-level domain concepts. The transfer struct
sends commands to its lifecycle aggregate, which handles crash recovery by
persisting state transitions as events.

##### Transfer Implementations

Two structs implement all four transfer directions:

- **`CrossVenueEquityTransfer`**: Exposes `resume_equity_to_market_making` (mint
  direction) and `resume_equity_to_hedging` (redemption direction). Holds stores
  for both equity lifecycle aggregates plus `Raindex` and `Tokenizer` service
  traits.

- **`CrossVenueCashTransfer`**: Exposes `resume_alpaca_to_base` and
  `resume_base_to_alpaca`. Holds a store for the `UsdcRebalance` lifecycle
  aggregate plus `Bridge`, `AlpacaFunding`, and onchain provider dependencies.

The lifecycle aggregates (TokenizedEquityMint, EquityRedemption, UsdcRebalance)
are implementation details of their respective transfer structs. External code
drives transfers only through the apalis jobs and their resume entry points.

Three lifecycle aggregates handle the transfer workflows.

#### TokenizedEquityMint Aggregate

**Purpose**: Transfers equity inventory from the hedging venue (Alpaca) to the
market making venue (Raindex) by tokenizing shares and depositing them to a
vault for liquidity provision.

**Aggregate ID**: IssuerRequestId (our internal tracking ID)

**Services**:
`EquityTransferServices { raindex: Arc<dyn Raindex>, tokenizer:
Arc<dyn Tokenizer>, wrapper: Arc<dyn Wrapper> }`
-- shared with `EquityRedemption`.

##### State Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> MintAccepted: RequestMint (calls request_mint)
    [*] --> Failed: RequestMint (rejected)
    MintAccepted --> TokensReceived: Poll (calls poll_mint_until_complete)
    MintAccepted --> Failed: Poll (rejected/error)
    TokensReceived --> TokensWrapped: WrapTokens
    TokensReceived --> Failed
    TokensWrapped --> DepositedIntoRaindex: DepositToVault
    TokensWrapped --> Failed
```

`RequestMint` is the initialize command -- it calls `request_mint()` on the
tokenizer service and emits `MintRequested` + `MintAccepted` atomically. If the
tokenizer rejects the request, it emits `MintRequested` + `MintRejected`.

`Poll` is a separate transition command that calls `poll_mint_until_complete()`
on the tokenizer service. This split ensures that the
`MintRequested`/`MintAccepted` events are persisted before the potentially
long-running poll begins.

Alpaca mints unwrapped tokens. Before depositing to Raindex, we wrap them into
ERC-4626 vault shares using the Wrapper service.

##### States

Terminal states store audit-critical fields not available from earlier events:

```rust
enum TokenizedEquityMint {
    MintRequested { symbol, quantity, wallet, requested_at },
    MintAccepted { /* + issuer_request_id, tokenization_request_id */ },
    TokensReceived { /* + token_tx_hash, receipt_id, shares_minted */ },
    TokensWrapped { /* + wrap_tx_hash, wrapped_shares */ },
    DepositedIntoRaindex { symbol, quantity, issuer_request_id,
        tokenization_request_id, token_tx_hash, wrap_tx_hash,
        vault_deposit_tx_hash, deposited_at },
    Failed { symbol, quantity, reason, requested_at, failed_at },
}
```

##### Commands

```rust
enum TokenizedEquityMintCommand {
    /// Initialize: calls tokenizer.request_mint(), emits
    /// MintRequested + MintAccepted (or MintRejected on rejection).
    RequestMint { issuer_request_id, symbol, quantity, wallet },
    /// Transition: calls tokenizer.poll_mint_until_complete(),
    /// emits TokensReceived (or MintAcceptanceFailed).
    Poll,
    WrapTokens { wrap_tx_hash, wrapped_shares },
    DepositToVault { vault_deposit_tx_hash },
}
```

##### Events

Each event captures data relevant to that state transition:

```rust
enum TokenizedEquityMintEvent {
    MintRequested { symbol, quantity, wallet, requested_at },

    MintAccepted { issuer_request_id, tokenization_request_id, accepted_at },
    MintAcceptanceFailed { reason, failed_at },

    TokensReceived { tx_hash, receipt_id, shares_minted, received_at },

    TokensWrapped { wrap_tx_hash, wrapped_shares, wrapped_at },
    WrappingFailed { reason, failed_at },

    DepositedIntoRaindex { vault_deposit_tx_hash, deposited_at },
    RaindexDepositFailed { reason, failed_at },

    MintRejected { reason, rejected_at },
}
```

##### Business Rules

- `RequestMint` only from uninitialized state; calls `request_mint()` on the
  tokenizer service to submit the request and get acceptance
- `Poll` only from MintAccepted state; calls `poll_mint_until_complete()` on the
  tokenizer service until tokens arrive or failure
- `WrapTokens` only from TokensReceived state; wraps unwrapped tokens into
  ERC-4626 shares
- `DepositToVault` only from TokensWrapped state
- DepositedIntoRaindex and Failed are terminal states

#### EquityRedemption Aggregate

**Purpose**: Transfers equity inventory from the market making venue (Raindex)
to the hedging venue (Alpaca) by withdrawing tokens from vault, sending them for
redemption, and receiving shares at Alpaca.

**Aggregate ID**: UUID for each transfer request

**Services**:
`EquityTransferServices { raindex: Arc<dyn Raindex>, tokenizer:
Arc<dyn Tokenizer>, wrapper: Arc<dyn Wrapper> }`
-- shared with `TokenizedEquityMint`.

##### State Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> WithdrawnFromRaindex: Withdraw
    WithdrawnFromRaindex --> TokensUnwrapped: Unwrap
    WithdrawnFromRaindex --> Failed
    TokensUnwrapped --> TokensSent: Send
    TokensUnwrapped --> Failed
    TokensSent --> Pending
    TokensSent --> Failed
    Pending --> Completed
    Pending --> Failed
```

- `Withdraw` command withdraws wrapped tokens from Raindex vault to wallet
- `WithdrawnFromRaindex` tracks wrapped tokens that left the vault but aren't
  yet unwrapped
- `Unwrap` command converts ERC-4626 wrapped tokens to unwrapped tokens
- `TokensUnwrapped` tracks unwrapped tokens ready to send
- `Send` command sends unwrapped tokens to Alpaca and polls until terminal
- `TokensSent` tracks tokens that have been sent to Alpaca's redemption wallet
- `Pending` indicates Alpaca detected the transfer
- `Completed` and `Failed` are terminal states

    // zeroes inflight correctly. A negative delta triggers a shortfall
    // adjustment.

        sent_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
    TransferFailed {
        tx_hash: Option<TxHash>,
        failed_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },

    Detected {
        tokenization_request_id: TokenizationRequestId,
        detected_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
    DetectionFailed {
        failure: DetectionFailure,
        failed_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },

    Completed {
        completed_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
    RedemptionRejected {
        reason: String,
        rejected_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
}

enum DetectionFailure {
    Timeout,
    ApiError { status_code: Option<u16> },
    // Operator-initiated force-fail of a TokensSent redemption; carries the
    // operator's --reason so the audit trail records why.
    Operator { reason: String },
}
```

The operator `fail` verb (`transfer fail --kind redemption`) dispatches per
state: a redemption stuck before tokens leave custody takes `FailTransfer`, a
`TokensSent` redemption takes `FailDetection { failure: Operator { reason } }`,
and a `Pending` redemption takes `RejectRedemption { reason }`. In every case
the replayed `Failed` state materializes the operator's reason.

##### Aggregate Services

The aggregate uses domain service traits directly as its Services:

```rust
struct EquityTransferServices {
    raindex: Arc<dyn Raindex>,
    tokenizer: Arc<dyn Tokenizer>,
    wrapper: Arc<dyn Wrapper>,
}
```

Both equity transfer aggregates share the same services type. Commands invoke
`Raindex` methods for vault operations, `Tokenizer` methods for tokenization and
redemption polling, and `Wrapper` methods for ERC-4626 wrapping/unwrapping.

##### Business Rules

- `Withdraw` only from uninitialized state; emits `WithdrawnFromRaindex`
- `Redeem` only from `WithdrawnFromRaindex` state; polls Alpaca until terminal
- If send fails after withdraw, aggregate stays in `WithdrawnFromRaindex`
  (tokens in wallet, not stranded)
- Completed and Failed are terminal states

#### UsdcRebalance Aggregate

**Purpose**: Manages bidirectional USDC movements between the hedging venue
(Alpaca) and the market making venue (Raindex) via Circle CCTP bridge.

**Aggregate ID**: Random UUID generated when rebalancing is initiated

Implements `EventSourced` with `Error = Never`. The enum contains only business
states; the uninitialized state is handled by the event-sorcery `Store`.

##### Crash-safe resume

Resuming a transfer after a crash must never re-execute an irreversible on-chain
action that already succeeded. Each phase records its intent (and the relevant
chain head) before the action, so resume can scan the chain to adopt an
already-submitted action instead of re-issuing it:

- `WithdrawalSubmitting` / `BridgingSubmitting`: scan the source chain for an
  already-submitted withdrawal / burn (`find_recent_withdrawal` /
  `find_recent_burn`) from the captured head and adopt it rather than
  withdrawing / burning twice.
- `Attested`: the CCTP mint is irreversible -- re-calling `receiveMessage`
  reverts on the already-used nonce, which would otherwise turn a successfully
  minted transfer into a terminal `BridgingFailed`. Resume must scan the
  destination chain for the already-submitted mint (`find_recent_mint`, matching
  the `MintAndWithdraw` event) and adopt it -- recording `ConfirmBridging` with
  the existing mint tx, amount, and fee -- before attempting a fresh mint. The
  destination chain head is captured when the attestation is recorded so the
  scan is bounded.

##### Business Rules

- Direction determines source and destination (AlpacaToBase: Ethereum mainnet ->
  Base, BaseToAlpaca: Base -> Ethereum mainnet)
- **USDC/USD Conversion**:
  - AlpacaToBase requires USD-to-USDC conversion BEFORE withdrawal (trading uses
    USD buying power, but CCTP bridge operates on USDC in Alpaca's crypto
    wallet)
  - BaseToAlpaca requires USDC-to-USD conversion AFTER deposit (USDC arrives in
    crypto wallet, must convert to USD buying power for trading)
  - Conversion uses USDC/USD crypto trading pair on Alpaca (market orders)
  - Crypto trading is available 24/7 on Alpaca (no market hours restrictions)
  - Market orders are near-instant but NOT guaranteed to fill immediately
  - Slippage: ~17bps observed in live tests (reduces effective USD received)
  - Partial fills: The system polls until the order is fully filled. Market
    orders for USDC/USD are expected to fill completely due to high liquidity.
    If an order enters a terminal failed state before full fill, the conversion
    fails and requires manual intervention.
  - Minimum withdrawal threshold ($51) accounts for slippage to ensure $50
    minimum is met after conversion
  - ConversionFailed is a terminal state (requires manual intervention)
  - ConversionComplete is terminal for BaseToAlpaca direction
- Alpaca withdrawals/deposits are asynchronous: initiate with API call (get
  transfer_id), poll status until COMPLETE
- Onchain transactions are asynchronous: submit tx (get tx_hash), wait for block
  inclusion and confirmation
- Source withdrawal must be confirmed before bridge burn
- Bridge burn transaction must be confirmed to extract CCTP nonce from event
  logs
- Attestation must be retrieved by polling Circle's REST API (~13 sec finality,
  no websocket option available)
- **Retryable attestation timeout**: an attestation poll timeout is recoverable,
  not a hard failure. `Bridging` moves to `AwaitingAttestation` (via
  `TimeoutAttestation`) and a delayed job re-polls until the attestation arrives
  or `retry_deadline_at` passes (`attestation_retry_deadline_secs`, a required
  config field, default 24h). On deadline elapse the transfer is marked
  `BridgingFailed` for operator reconciliation. The deadline is a soft bound:
  checked between polls, so it can overshoot by up to one poll window plus the
  redrive delay. Structural failures detected _after_ a `complete` attestation
  is fetched (e.g. an all-zero placeholder nonce) fail the bridge immediately.
  Failures _within_ the poll loop (HTTP errors, a still-`pending` or malformed
  `complete` response) are retried and, once the per-poll attempts exhaust,
  surface as the same retryable timeout -- so a malformed response is bounded by
  the deadline rather than failing fast. (Failing fast on a definitively
  malformed `complete` response is a tracked follow-up.)
- **Attested resume reconstructs the mint offline (no Circle re-poll)**: the
  mint needs the full CCTP message envelope, which `BridgeAttestationReceived`
  persists (the `message` field) alongside the attestation. Resuming from
  `Attested` reconstructs the `AttestationResponse` from the stored envelope and
  attestation -- re-deriving and cross-checking the nonce against the recorded
  `cctp_nonce` -- and mints with no Circle call. A reconstruction failure
  (corrupt envelope, placeholder nonce, or nonce mismatch) marks
  `BridgingFailed` for operator reconciliation, since the USDC is already
  burned. Transfers whose `BridgeAttestationReceived` predates the `message`
  field carry `None` and fall back to re-polling Circle: the attestation is
  permanently retrievable, so a timeout there retries until success rather than
  failing (bounding it would strand recoverable funds). The
  `attestation_retry_deadline` bounds only the `AwaitingAttestation` wait (where
  the attestation may never arrive).
- Bridge mint transaction requires valid attestation
- Bridge mint transaction must be confirmed before destination deposit
- A `receiveMessage()` revert because the CCTP nonce was already used is
  idempotent success only when destination-chain logs confirm all of the
  following: (1) a `MessageReceived` event for that nonce exists whose source
  domain and message body match the attested message; (2) the transaction that
  emitted that `MessageReceived` also emitted `MintAndWithdraw`. Transaction
  success is implicit since reverted transactions emit no logs. Any source
  domain or message body mismatch, or absence of the expected `MintAndWithdraw`,
  means the revert remains a bridge mint failure
- Destination deposit must be confirmed to complete rebalancing (for
  AlpacaToBase) or before post-deposit conversion (for BaseToAlpaca)
- Can mark failed from any non-terminal state
- Each rebalancing has unique UUID allowing multiple parallel operations
- **Operator reconciliation** (`ReconcileStuckRebalance` -> `OperatorReconciled`
  -> `Reconciled`): valid ONLY from a post-burn terminal failure that strands
  the rebalancing guard with no other exit -- `DepositFailed`, a post-burn
  `BridgingFailed` (a `burn_tx_hash` or `cctp_nonce` is recorded), or a
  `BaseToAlpaca` `ConversionFailed` (the post-deposit USDC->USD leg). Every
  other state is rejected: an in-progress transfer must be resumed, and a
  pre-burn failure already reconciles to source on its own. `Reconciled` is a
  clearing terminal -- it carries **post-burn semantics**, meaning the reactor
  zeroes source-venue inflight WITHOUT crediting `available` (the USDC was
  already burned via CCTP, so the funds genuinely left the source venue; this is
  NOT a cancel, which would wrongly credit `available`). See "Operator
  reconciliation of a stranded post-burn failure" under Failure Handling.

##### Integration Points

- **Alpaca API**: Withdraw/deposit USDC
- **Circle CCTP (Ethereum mainnet)**: TokenMessenger contract at
  0x28b5a0e9C621a5BadaA536219b3a228C8168cf5d
- **Circle CCTP (Base)**: Same TokenMessenger contract address
- **CCTP Domain IDs**: Ethereum = 0, Base = 6
- **Circle Attestation API**: Poll for attestation using CCTP nonce
- **Rain OrderBook**: deposit2()/withdraw2() for vault operations

##### CCTP Allowance (Standing U256::MAX Approval)

Before each `depositForBurn`, the bridge checks the wallet's USDC allowance to
the TokenMessenger. The bridge maintains a **standing `U256::MAX` allowance**
rather than approving the exact burn amount each time.

**Hot path (steady state):** If the allowance is at or above `U256::MAX / 2`
(the threshold), no approve tx is submitted. This is the normal case.

**Cold path (first use or allowance has been externally reduced):** An
`approve(TokenMessenger, U256::MAX)` tx is submitted and confirmed. After
confirmation, the bridge calls `wait_for_node_sync` to poll `eth_blockNumber`
until at least one poll through the load-balanced endpoint returns a block at or
above the approve block. This significantly reduces (but does not fully
eliminate) the chance that the subsequent `depositForBurn` pre-flight `eth_call`
hits a lagging node that reads allowance = 0 and reverts. The cross-node race is
bounded by (a) the standing `U256::MAX` allowance meaning the cold path fires
only on first use or a manual reset, and (b) the defense-in-depth retry below.

**Defense-in-depth retry:** If `depositForBurn` reverts despite the above
(structurally: re-read allowance < burn amount), the bridge re-runs the cold
path and retries the burn exactly once. This handles rare cases where the
node-sync poll window expires before a node catches up. If the bridge-level
one-shot retry also fails, the job-level bounded redrive (described below) takes
over.

#### Self-Healing and Alerting

##### Transient burn-revert self-heal (bounded redrive)

A Base->Alpaca transfer job that receives a revert-class CCTP burn error (where
`CctpError::is_revert()` is true, indicating a pre-submission chain revert with
no on-chain effect) is reclassified as a safe redrive rather than a
circuit-breaker trip. The job returns `Ok` and re-enqueues itself with a 15 s
delay, re-entering the `resume_bridging_submitting` scan-or-reburn path on the
next pickup.

The double-burn safety guarantee is NOT `is_revert()` classification -- it is
the `resume_bridging_submitting` scan: `find_recent_burn` scans for an existing
burn before re-attempting, using the `from_block` lower bound durably recorded
in the `BridgingSubmitting` aggregate event before the burn call. Even a
misclassified error cannot cause a double-burn because the scan adopts any
existing burn.

A per-attempt wall-clock timeout is similarly reclassified: the hung attempt is
aborted and the job re-enqueues with a 30 s delay. The scan alone is
mempool-blind -- it adopts only a MINED burn, not one that was broadcast but not
yet mined -- so the two-phase burn records the tx hash as soon as it is
broadcast: `submit_burn` broadcasts and returns the hash without awaiting the
receipt, `RecordPendingBurn` commits it to the `BridgingSubmitting` aggregate
(`pending_burn_tx`), then `confirm_burn` awaits and validates the receipt. The
`submit_burn -> RecordPendingBurn` critical section runs on a detached task so
the per-attempt timeout can never cancel it between broadcasting the burn and
recording its hash. A process crash in that same window is NOT prevented -- the
hash is lost -- but it cannot double-burn: resume then finds no recorded hash,
the mempool-blind scan adopts the burn only if it already mined, and otherwise
the transfer fails closed (`BurnSubmitInconclusive`) for operator reconciliation
rather than reburning a possibly-still-pending burn. On re-pickup,
`resume_bridging_submitting` checks the recorded tx's on-chain status
(`burn_status`) before the scan: a mined burn is adopted (re-validated via
`confirm_burn`), a still-pending burn yields a delayed redrive (never a reburn),
and a reverted burn (which moved no funds) falls through to the scan-or-reburn
path. A burn classified **dropped** does **not** auto-reburn: once a burn tx
hash is durably recorded, an ambiguous "dropped" classification pages the
operator (a terminal `BurnTxDropped` error) for manual on-chain verification,
because a load-balanced RPC could misreport a still-pending burn as dropped and
a reburn there would double-burn. `burn_status` mirrors the wallet's
`wait_for_receipt` drop policy (a grace window plus consecutive mempool-absence
misses) so a still-pending tx is never misclassified as dropped.

**Bound**: Both revert and timeout redrives count against a shared
`max_burn_revert_redrives` counter persisted in the job payload (durable across
restarts). Once the bound is reached, the job propagates a
`BurnRevertLimitReached` error so its worker circuit opens and the operator is
alerted. Genuinely ambiguous failures (where the burn may have landed and
`is_revert()` returns false, e.g. `MessageSentEventNotFound`) are never
reclassified and always pause their worker for operator review before automatic
recovery.

**Alerting**: A Telegram alert fires at the warn threshold (`max / 2 + 1`
redrives), at the limit, and before any terminal non-redriven error propagates.

##### Startup re-arm for `BridgingSubmitting` and `WithdrawalSubmitting{BaseToAlpaca}`

On startup, `recover_usdc_guard` re-arms transfer jobs for aggregates at
`BridgingSubmitting` (both directions) or `WithdrawalSubmitting{BaseToAlpaca}`
state that have no pending job row. These states are non-terminal and resumable:
the process either crashed before the burn tx was submitted, or before the
apalis enqueue committed. The re-arm is idempotent (suppressed if a job row
exists) and runs before the apalis monitor starts so there is no live-job race.

`WithdrawalSubmitting{AlpacaToBase}` is **NOT** auto-re-armed: the withdrawal
transfer ID has not yet been persisted in that state (it is persisted only when
`Withdrawing` is entered), so `resume_alpaca_to_base` returns
`ResumeDirectionMismatch` and cannot reconstruct which Alpaca withdrawal to
poll. When a crash leaves an aggregate in this state, `recover_usdc_guard`
latches `usdc_in_progress` (no USDC rebalancing proceeds) and fires an operator
alert via `self.notifier` so the operator is paged to run `transfer resume` or
`transfer reconcile` manually.

These states do NOT receive a tracking seed (unlike `DepositFailed` /
`ConversionFailed` / `BridgingFailed{burn_tx=Some}`): seeding tracking for a
mid-flight resumable state would wedge the `DepositConfirmed` path which
requires `bridged_amount_received` that the seed cannot supply. The re-arm path
(job re-enqueue) handles them; the sweep path is for manually-reconcilable
terminal states only.

###### Known limitations / follow-ups

- **`WithdrawalSubmitting{AlpacaToBase}` is not auto-resumable**: Making this
  state resumable requires persisting the withdrawal identity (Alpaca transfer
  ID) before entering `WithdrawalSubmitting` and adding a corresponding resume
  arm in `resume_alpaca_to_base`. This is deferred work; for now the operator is
  alerted and must reconcile manually.
- **`Withdrawing{AlpacaToBase}` / `WithdrawalComplete{AlpacaToBase}` ARE
  auto-re-armed on startup**: The Alpaca transfer ID is durably recorded in
  `Withdrawing`; `resume_alpaca_to_base` re-polls the same transfer
  (idempotent). `WithdrawalComplete` means the source withdrawal already moved
  funds into the market-maker wallet; resume scans for an existing CCTP burn
  before submitting one. Startup recovery enqueues a fresh
  `TransferUsdcToMarketMaking` job for either state when no live job row exists.
- **Unresolved/unparseable aggregate IDs**: Aggregates that are missing from the
  store or have unparseable IDs also latch the guard with an operator alert.
  These indicate store inconsistency and require manual investigation.

Note: USDC (FiatToken v2.2) decrements even `U256::MAX` allowances in
`transferFrom`. At realistic rebalancing sizes the allowance never drops below
`U256::MAX / 2`, so the approve fires once at startup and not again. The
single-USDC-rebalance-in-flight invariant ensures two concurrent burns cannot
race the same allowance.

##### CCTP Flow (using V2 Fast Transfer)

Alpaca to Base:

1. **Convert USD to USDC**: Place market sell order on USDC/USD pair (buy USDC)
2. Poll Alpaca until conversion order is filled
3. Initiate USDC withdrawal from Alpaca (get transfer_id)
4. Poll Alpaca API until withdrawal status is COMPLETE
   - **Poll inconclusive durability**: if `poll_transfer_until_complete` returns
     any indeterminate error (30-minute timeout, transport/network error,
     non-retried API error), the job does NOT emit `FailWithdrawal`. The
     aggregate stays in `Withdrawing` (guard held, Alpaca transfer ID recorded).
     The job schedules an unbounded delayed redrive (like
     `SettlementCheckTransient`). On re-pickup, `resume_alpaca_to_base` re-polls
     the same Alpaca transfer via the recorded ID: if Alpaca now reports
     Complete the withdrawal is adopted; if Failed with no returned tx hash,
     `FailWithdrawal` is emitted normally; if Failed with a tx hash, or if still
     in progress, another delayed redrive fires. Only `TransferStatus::Failed`
     with no returned tx hash (Alpaca's determinate terminal for a withdrawal
     that did not broadcast on-chain) is safe to auto-emit `FailWithdrawal`.

     This closes the re-withdrawal window: `Withdrawing` holds the guard so no
     new withdrawal starts while the prior one may still be in progress. If the
     chain later strands at `WithdrawalComplete`, the guard is also preserved
     and the same market-making redrive resumes from the recorded state.
     Re-polling is idempotent (reads only; never re-initiates the withdrawal),
     so unbounded redrives are safe. An operator can interrupt via
     `transfer resume` at any time to manually re-drive.

     **Operator alert (deadline-based)**: at or after 4 hours of inconclusive
     polling (measured from `Withdrawing.initiated_at`, a durable aggregate
     field that survives restarts) the job begins paging the operator on every
     redrive while still keeping the guard held and continuing to re-poll. The
     4-hour threshold gives headroom above the 30-minute internal poll timeout
     while ensuring a permanent failure (rotated credentials, Alpaca API shape
     change) surfaces well before it becomes a multi-day outage.
   - **Settlement gate (before proceeding):** wait for the withdrawal tx to
     reach the required confirmations on Ethereum. Alpaca marks a withdrawal
     "Complete" before the on-chain tx is settled network-wide on load-balanced
     RPC nodes; burning against an unconfirmed balance causes an ERC20
     transfer-exceeds-balance revert. This gate is retryable.
   - **Balance read:** after confirmation, read the market-maker Ethereum wallet
     USDC balance. Three cases:
     - **balance == 0**: delayed redrive (withdrawal not yet reflected;
       retried).
     - **0 < balance <= nominal**: burn the received amount (nominal minus any
       Alpaca withdrawal fee). Persisted in `BridgingSubmitting.burn_amount` so
       a crash-resume scan targets the exact burned amount, not the nominal.
     - **balance > nominal**: wallet-empty invariant broken — ambient/residual
       USDC from a prior rebalance is present. Emits `FailBridging` (no burn
       attempted) and surfaces `WalletUsdcAmbientBalance` for operator
       reconciliation; the job treats this as a clean terminal (no redrive).
5. Ensure standing allowance to TokenMessenger (see above)
6. Query Circle's `/v2/burn/USDC/fees` API for current fast transfer fee (after
   allowance step to keep fee fresh across the cold-path ~30 s node-sync wait)
7. Submit depositForBurn() tx on Ethereum TokenMessenger (domain 0 -> domain 6)
   with minFinalityThreshold=1000 and calculated maxFee for fast transfer
8. Wait for burn tx confirmation and extract CCTP nonce from event logs
9. Poll Circle attestation service for signature using CCTP nonce (~20 seconds
   for fast transfer)
10. Submit receiveMessage() tx on Base MessageTransmitter with attestation
11. Wait for mint tx confirmation (~8 seconds on Base)
12. Submit deposit tx to Rain orderbook vault on Base
13. Wait for deposit tx confirmation

Base to Alpaca:

1. Submit withdraw tx from Rain orderbook vault on Base
2. Wait for withdraw tx confirmation
3. Ensure standing allowance to TokenMessenger on Base (see above)
4. Query Circle's `/v2/burn/USDC/fees` API for current fast transfer fee (after
   allowance step to keep fee fresh across the cold-path ~30 s node-sync wait)
5. Submit depositForBurn() tx on Base TokenMessenger (domain 6 -> domain 0) with
   minFinalityThreshold=1000 and calculated maxFee for fast transfer
6. Wait for burn tx confirmation and extract CCTP nonce from event logs
7. Poll Circle attestation service for signature using CCTP nonce (~8 seconds
   for fast transfer)
8. Submit receiveMessage() tx on Ethereum MessageTransmitter with attestation
   (mints USDC to the bot's own Ethereum wallet)
9. Wait for mint tx confirmation (~20 seconds on Ethereum)
10. Send the minted USDC from the bot wallet to Alpaca's deposit address (see
    "BaseToAlpaca deposit send"; fresh sends directly, resume adopts an existing
    send)
11. Poll Alpaca API by the send tx until deposit status is COMPLETE
12. **Convert USDC to USD**: Place market sell order on USDC/USD pair (sell
    USDC)
13. Poll Alpaca until conversion order is filled

###### Fast Transfer Benefits

- **Timing**: ~20-30 seconds for CCTP bridge portion vs 13-19 minutes standard
  transfer (50-80x faster)
- **Cost**: 1 basis point (0.01%) fee per transfer
- **Total rebalancing time**: Dominated by Alpaca deposit/withdrawal (~minutes)
  rather than bridge time

#### Wrapped Equity Recovery

**Purpose**: Automatically return wrapped equity tokens (wtSTOCK) found in the
bot wallet on Base to a venue that participates in market making, without
operator intervention. Wallet wtSTOCK arises whenever the normal transfer flow
fails to deliver to its destination -- a `TokenizedEquityMint` stalled after
wrapping but before depositing into Raindex, an `EquityRedemption` stalled after
withdrawing from Raindex but before unwrapping, or tokens arrived at the wallet
without any matching in-flight transfer (external deposit, prior-process crash
after compaction).

The mechanism has three components:

1. **Detection** — the inventory polling job already reads ERC-20 balances on
   the bot wallet. When it observes a non-zero wtSTOCK balance it emits
   `InventorySnapshotEvent::BaseWalletWrappedEquity { balances }`; the
   rebalancing reactor consumes that event and enqueues one
   `WrappedEquityRecoveryJob { symbol }` per symbol with a positive balance.
2. **Dispatch** — the recovery job inspects `InventoryView` and chooses one of
   three paths based on whether an active mint or redemption owns the symbol's
   in-flight slot.
3. **Audit** — a `WrappedEquityRecovery` aggregate records every recovery
   attempt, the dispatch decision, the side-effecting steps for the orphan path,
   and the terminal outcome.

##### Recovery Paths

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Detect[BaseWalletWrappedEquity observed]
    Detect --> CheckMint{InventoryView.active_mints<br/>has symbol?}
    CheckMint -- yes --> ResumeMint[resume_mint mint_id]
    CheckMint -- no --> CheckRedemption{InventoryView.active_redemptions<br/>has symbol?}
    CheckRedemption -- yes --> ResumeRedemption[resume_redemption id]
    CheckRedemption -- no --> Orphan[Raindex submit_deposit]
    ResumeMint --> Done[wtSTOCK back in Raindex vault]
    ResumeRedemption --> Done2[wtSTOCK unwrapped + sent to broker]
    Orphan --> Confirm[confirm deposit tx]
    Confirm --> Done
```

- **Active mint** -- the wtSTOCK belongs to a `TokenizedEquityMint` that reached
  `TokensWrapped` but never deposited. The dispatcher loads the aggregate via
  the ID stored in `InventoryView.active_mints[symbol]` and calls
  `CrossVenueEquityTransfer::resume_mint`; the existing mint flow drives it to
  `DepositedIntoRaindex`.
- **Active redemption** -- the wtSTOCK belongs to an `EquityRedemption` that
  reached `WithdrawnFromRaindex` but never unwrapped. The dispatcher loads it
  via `InventoryView.active_redemptions[symbol]` and calls `resume_redemption`;
  the redemption flow continues through unwrap and send.
- **Orphan deposit** -- no aggregate owns the symbol's in-flight slot, so the
  wallet wtSTOCK is unused liquidity. The market-making venue is the closest
  place to redeploy it (no broker round-trip), so the dispatcher resolves the
  wrapped-token address via `Wrapper::lookup_derivative`, looks up the Raindex
  vault, submits a deposit, and waits for confirmation.

A symbol can only be in one in-flight transfer at a time; an `InventoryView`
that reports both an active mint and an active redemption for the same symbol is
a corrupt-state signal. The dispatcher refuses to choose between them: it emits
`FailRecovery` with a reason that names both aggregate IDs and surfaces the
conflict to the operator instead of silently picking one path.

##### Concurrency

The job claims the same `equity_in_progress` guard the normal rebalancing
trigger uses. If another task is already driving the symbol's transfer the
recovery job logs at debug and exits without writing an aggregate; the next
polling tick re-evaluates. This keeps recovery dispatch from racing the
mint/redemption tasks already driven by apalis.

##### Idempotency

Each polled `BaseWalletWrappedEquity` snapshot triggers a fresh
`WrappedEquityRecoveryJob`. If the previous recovery already drained the wallet
the next job sees an empty balance and exits without writing an aggregate. If
the previous recovery is still running the `equity_in_progress` guard ensures
the new job exits.

##### WrappedEquityRecovery Aggregate

The audit trail AND the actor for recovery side effects. Persists one aggregate
instance per detection-and-dispatch attempt -- multiple recoveries for the same
symbol are independent aggregates, keyed by `WrappedEquityRecoveryId(Uuid)`.

`Services = WrappedEquityRecoveryServices { raindex: Arc<dyn Raindex>,
wrapper: Arc<dyn Wrapper>, transfer: Arc<CrossVenueEquityTransfer> }`
-- each command handler that needs an external side effect (orphan deposit
submit/confirm, mint resume, redemption resume) calls the corresponding service
inside the handler and emits the resulting event only on success. This mirrors
`TokenizedEquityMint` and `EquityRedemption` (both use `EquityTransferServices`
the same way) and keeps the audit trail tight: no event is recorded for a side
effect that didn't actually happen.

The job's responsibility is purely orchestration -- read `InventoryView`, pick a
dispatch path, and send the command sequence: `Detect`, then exactly one of
`DispatchToMint`, `DispatchToRedemption`, or
`SubmitOrphanDeposit +
ConfirmOrphanDeposit`. The dispatch-success and
orphan-deposit states are themselves terminal, so no separate completion command
is needed. The job does not call services directly.

The underlying `TokenizedEquityMint` / `EquityRedemption` aggregate continues to
own the active-transfer paths' physical work and its own event stream; this
aggregate records the dispatch decision (after `resume_*` returns Ok) and, for
the orphan path, captures the resulting tx hash.

###### State Flow

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Detected: Detect (records symbol + shares)
    Detected --> DispatchedToMint: DispatchToMint (active mint found)
    Detected --> DispatchedToRedemption: DispatchToRedemption (active redemption found)
    Detected --> OrphanDepositSubmitted: SubmitOrphanDeposit (no active transfer)
    OrphanDepositSubmitted --> OrphanDeposited: ConfirmOrphanDeposit
    DispatchedToMint --> [*]
    DispatchedToRedemption --> [*]
    OrphanDeposited --> [*]
    Detected --> Failed: FailRecovery
    OrphanDepositSubmitted --> Failed: FailRecovery
```

The dispatch-success states (`DispatchedToMint`, `DispatchedToRedemption`,
`OrphanDeposited`) are themselves terminal -- they already encode which path
succeeded and with which `mint_id` / `redemption_id` / `tx_hash`. No separate
`Completed` state is needed.

- `Detect` is the initialization command and records the trigger (symbol,
  wrapped share quantity, detected_at). The job sends it as soon as it observes
  a non-zero balance for the symbol. No services are invoked.
- `DispatchToMint { mint_id }` / `DispatchToRedemption { redemption_id }`: the
  handler calls `services.transfer.resume_mint(mint_id)` (or
  `resume_redemption`) and emits the corresponding `DispatchedTo*` event only
  after `resume_*` returns Ok. The audit trail for the actual deposit/unwrap
  lives on the underlying mint/redemption aggregate's event stream; this
  aggregate records the dispatch decision. The resulting state is
  terminal-success for the path.
- `SubmitOrphanDeposit` (no params): the handler resolves the wrapped-token
  address via `services.wrapper.lookup_derivative(symbol)`, looks up the Raindex
  vault, calls `services.raindex.submit_deposit(...)`, and emits
  `OrphanDepositSubmitted { vault_deposit_tx_hash }` with the returned hash. The
  event is emitted iff the deposit was actually submitted on-chain. Records the
  tx hash so a process crash between submit and confirm resumes from the
  persisted hash on retry.
- `ConfirmOrphanDeposit` (no params): the handler reads `vault_deposit_tx_hash`
  from the current `OrphanDepositSubmitted` state, calls
  `services.raindex.confirm_tx(tx_hash)`, and emits `OrphanDeposited` with the
  same hash. Requires the configured number of confirmations. The resulting
  state is terminal-success.
- `FailRecovery { reason }`: explicit failure from any non-terminal state.
  Records the reason for downstream investigation. Service-call failures inside
  the dispatch handlers also emit `RecoveryFailed` (consistent with
  `TokenizedEquityMint`'s `MintAcceptanceFailed` pattern) so failures remain
  first-class events.

###### States

```rust
enum WrappedEquityRecovery {
    Detected { symbol, shares, detected_at },
    DispatchedToMint { symbol, shares, detected_at, mint_id, dispatched_at },        // terminal
    DispatchedToRedemption {                                                          // terminal
        symbol, shares, detected_at, redemption_id, dispatched_at,
    },
    OrphanDepositSubmitted {
        symbol, shares, detected_at, vault_deposit_tx_hash, submitted_at,
    },
    OrphanDeposited {                                                                 // terminal
        symbol, shares, detected_at, vault_deposit_tx_hash, submitted_at, deposited_at,
    },
    Failed { symbol, shares, reason, failed_at },                                     // terminal
}
```

###### Commands

```rust
enum WrappedEquityRecoveryCommand {
    Detect { symbol, shares },
    DispatchToMint { mint_id },                // services.transfer.resume_mint
    DispatchToRedemption { redemption_id },    // services.transfer.resume_redemption
    SubmitOrphanDeposit,                       // services.{wrapper,raindex}.*
    ConfirmOrphanDeposit,                      // services.raindex.confirm_tx
    FailRecovery { reason },
}
```

###### Events

```rust
enum WrappedEquityRecoveryEvent {
    Detected { symbol, shares, detected_at },
    DispatchedToMint { mint_id, dispatched_at },
    DispatchedToRedemption { redemption_id, dispatched_at },
    OrphanDepositSubmitted { vault_deposit_tx_hash, submitted_at },
    OrphanDeposited { vault_deposit_tx_hash, deposited_at },
    RecoveryFailed { reason, failed_at },
}
```

###### Business Rules

- `Detect` only initializes; subsequent `Detect` commands on a live aggregate
  are rejected.
- `DispatchToMint` / `DispatchToRedemption` / `SubmitOrphanDeposit` are only
  valid from `Detected` and are mutually exclusive -- at most one is dispatched
  per recovery.
- `ConfirmOrphanDeposit` is only valid from `OrphanDepositSubmitted` and only
  succeeds after the confirmation count required by the onchain config.
- All dispatch handlers run their side effect inside the command handler so the
  success event is emitted iff the side effect actually completed. Service
  failures are recorded as `RecoveryFailed`.
- `DispatchedToMint`, `DispatchedToRedemption`, `OrphanDeposited`, and `Failed`
  are terminal states.

###### Job-level Idempotency

The recovery job carries its `WrappedEquityRecoveryId` in the apalis payload
(generated by the reactor when pushing). On retry, apalis re-runs `perform` with
the same payload, so the job re-targets the same aggregate; the framework
reloads its current state and the next command in the sequence picks up where
the prior attempt stopped (e.g., if `SubmitOrphanDeposit` succeeded but
`ConfirmOrphanDeposit` crashed before persisting, the retry skips submit and
goes straight to confirm).

This is at-least-once for side effects: a crash between `submit_deposit`
returning and the `OrphanDepositSubmitted` event persisting will still re-submit
on retry. The aggregate-level guarantee is that no terminal event is recorded
for a side effect that didn't actually succeed.

#### Unwrapped Equity Recovery

**Purpose**: Automatically return unwrapped equity tokens (tSTOCK) found in the
bot wallet on Base to a venue that participates in market making, without
operator intervention. Wallet tSTOCK arises whenever the normal transfer flow
fails to deliver the wrapped form to its destination -- a `TokenizedEquityMint`
stalled after `TokensReceived` but before wrapping, an `EquityRedemption`
stalled after `TokensUnwrapped` but before sending to the broker, or tokens
arrived at the wallet without any matching in-flight transfer (external deposit,
prior-process crash, or false-positive `TransactionDropped` from a laggy RPC
backend that left the bot believing a wrap attempt failed).

The mechanism mirrors [Wrapped Equity Recovery](#wrapped-equity-recovery):
detection from the inventory poll, dispatch by `InventoryView`, audit via a
dedicated aggregate. It differs in two places:

- **Orphan path also wraps**. Wrapped recovery deposits the existing wtSTOCK
  straight into the Raindex vault. Unwrapped recovery first wraps the tSTOCK
  into the ERC-4626 vault share, then deposits into Raindex -- two on-chain
  steps the aggregate must persist independently so a crash between them can
  resume from the wrap tx hash without double-wrapping.
- **Active redemption path sends to broker**. A redemption that stalled at
  `TokensUnwrapped` has already withdrawn from Raindex and unwrapped; the
  remaining work is the off-chain transfer to the Alpaca redemption wallet.

##### Recovery Paths

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Detect[BaseWalletUnwrappedEquity observed]
    Detect --> CheckMint{InventoryView.active_mints<br/>has symbol?}
    CheckMint -- yes --> ResumeMint[resume_mint mint_id]
    CheckMint -- no --> CheckRedemption{InventoryView.active_redemptions<br/>has symbol?}
    CheckRedemption -- yes --> ResumeRedemption[resume_redemption id]
    CheckRedemption -- no --> OrphanWrap[Wrapper wrap]
    ResumeMint --> Done[tSTOCK wrapped + back in Raindex vault]
    ResumeRedemption --> Done2[tSTOCK sent to broker]
    OrphanWrap --> ConfirmWrap[confirm wrap tx]
    ConfirmWrap --> OrphanDeposit[Raindex submit_deposit]
    OrphanDeposit --> ConfirmDeposit[confirm deposit tx]
    ConfirmDeposit --> Done
```

- **Active mint** -- the tSTOCK belongs to a `TokenizedEquityMint` that reached
  `TokensReceived` but never wrapped. The dispatcher loads the aggregate via the
  ID stored in `InventoryView.active_mints[symbol]` and calls
  `CrossVenueEquityTransfer::resume_mint`; the existing mint flow drives it
  through wrap and deposit to `DepositedIntoRaindex`.
- **Active redemption** -- the tSTOCK belongs to an `EquityRedemption` that
  reached `TokensUnwrapped` but never sent. The dispatcher loads it via
  `InventoryView.active_redemptions[symbol]` and calls `resume_redemption`; the
  redemption flow finishes the broker-side transfer.
- **Orphan deposit** -- no aggregate owns the symbol's in-flight slot, so the
  wallet tSTOCK is unused liquidity. The market-making venue is the closest
  redeploy target, so the dispatcher resolves the token + wrapper-vault pair via
  `Wrapper::lookup_underlying` / `lookup_derivative`, wraps the tokens, waits
  for the wrap receipt, submits a Raindex deposit, and waits for the deposit
  receipt.

A symbol can only be in one in-flight transfer at a time; an `InventoryView`
that reports both an active mint and an active redemption for the same symbol is
a corrupt-state signal. The dispatcher refuses to choose between them: it emits
`FailRecovery` with a reason that names both aggregate IDs and surfaces the
conflict to the operator instead of silently picking one path.

##### Concurrency

The job claims the same `equity_in_progress` guard the normal rebalancing
trigger uses, exactly like
[`WrappedEquityRecovery`](#wrappedequityrecovery-aggregate).

##### Idempotency

Each polled `BaseWalletUnwrappedEquity` snapshot triggers a fresh
`UnwrappedEquityRecoveryJob`. If the previous recovery already wrapped and
deposited the tokens, the next job sees an empty unwrapped balance and exits
without writing an aggregate. The `equity_in_progress` guard prevents
overlapping runs against the same symbol.

##### UnwrappedEquityRecovery Aggregate

The audit trail AND the actor for recovery side effects, keyed by
`UnwrappedEquityRecoveryId(Uuid)`. Each detection-and-dispatch attempt is its
own aggregate instance.

`Services = UnwrappedEquityRecoveryServices { raindex: Arc<dyn Raindex>,
wrapper: Arc<dyn Wrapper>, transfer: Arc<CrossVenueEquityTransfer>,
wallet: Address }`
-- differs from `WrappedEquityRecoveryServices` by the added `wallet: Address`,
the bot wallet on Base that is both the wrap receiver and the address the orphan
deposit pulls wrapped tokens from.

The job's responsibility is purely orchestration -- read `InventoryView`, pick a
dispatch path, and send the command sequence: `Detect`, then exactly one of
`DispatchToMint`, `DispatchToRedemption`, or
`SubmitOrphanWrap + ConfirmOrphanWrap + SubmitOrphanDeposit +
ConfirmOrphanDeposit`.
The dispatch-success states are terminal.

###### Commands

    Detect { symbol, shares },
    DispatchToMint { mint_id },                // services.transfer.resume_mint
    DispatchToRedemption { redemption_id },    // services.transfer.resume_redemption

###### Events

```rust
enum UnwrappedEquityRecoveryEvent {
    Detected { symbol, shares, detected_at },
    DispatchedToMint { mint_id, dispatched_at },
    DispatchedToRedemption { redemption_id, dispatched_at },
    OrphanWrapSubmitted { wrap_tx_hash, submitted_at },
    OrphanWrapped { wrap_tx_hash, wrapped_at },
    OrphanDepositSubmitted { vault_deposit_tx_hash, submitted_at },
    OrphanDeposited { vault_deposit_tx_hash, deposited_at },
    RecoveryFailed { reason, failed_at },
}
```

###### Business Rules

- `Detect` only initializes; subsequent `Detect` commands on a live aggregate
  are rejected.
- `DispatchToMint` / `DispatchToRedemption` / `SubmitOrphanWrap` are only valid
  from `Detected` and are mutually exclusive -- at most one is dispatched per
  recovery.
- The orphan path's four commands must be sent in order; each is only valid from
  its predecessor's terminal-for-step state.
- `ConfirmOrphanWrap` and `ConfirmOrphanDeposit` only succeed after the
  configured confirmation count, mirroring the wrapped recovery's
  `confirm_deposit` semantics.
- All dispatch handlers run their side effect inside the command handler so the
  success event is emitted iff the side effect actually completed.
- Terminal states: `DispatchedToMint`, `DispatchedToRedemption`,
  `OrphanDeposited`, `Failed`.

###### Job-level Idempotency

Same model as `WrappedEquityRecoveryJob`: the apalis payload carries the
`UnwrappedEquityRecoveryId` so retries re-target the same aggregate and resume
from the next non-terminal command. There is no `client_order_id` or nonce-based
replay-protection at the wrapper layer -- `submit_wrap` takes only
`(wrapped_token, underlying_amount, wallet)`, and wrapping is an on-chain
ERC-4626 deposit, not a broker call. The crash-window guard is the aggregate
state machine instead: a retry that finds `OrphanWrapSubmitted` already
persisted resumes at `ConfirmOrphanWrap` rather than re-wrapping. The one
un-guarded window is a wrap that lands on-chain but crashes before
`OrphanWrapSubmitted` persists -- the aggregate is still `Detected`, so the
retry re-submits. Funds are not lost: the surplus wtSTOCK is swept by the
wrapped recovery path, though the original aggregate may terminate in `Failed`.

#### Rebalancing Triggers

##### Inventory Tracking

The system tracks two separate inventory categories:

1. **Per-Symbol Equity Inventory**: Each tokenized equity (AAPL, MSFT, etc.) has
   independent inventory tracked across venues
   - Onchain: Tokens in Rain orderbook vaults (Base)
   - Offchain: Shares in Alpaca account
   - Example: AAPL might be 80% onchain while MSFT is 30% onchain

2. **Global USDC Inventory**: Total USDC across both venues
   - Onchain: USDC in Rain orderbook vaults (Base)
   - Offchain: USDC in Alpaca account
   - Single global ratio (not per-symbol)

##### Imbalance Detection

InventoryView calculates imbalances after each position or rebalancing event by
checking per-symbol equity ratios and global USDC ratio against configured
thresholds. When deviation exceeds the threshold and minimum amounts are met, it
emits imbalance detection events.

**Rebalancing Parameters** (configurable per environment):

- **Equity per symbol**:
  - Target ratio: 0.5 (aim for 50% onchain, 50% offchain)
  - Deviation threshold: 0.2 (trigger when ratio deviates by +/-0.2 from target)
  - Example: Triggers at <0.3 (mint) or >0.7 (redeem)
  - Minimum rebalancing amount: e.g., $1000 equivalent to avoid tiny operations
- **USDC global**:
  - Target ratio: 0.5 (aim for 50% onchain, 50% offchain)
  - Deviation threshold: 0.3 (trigger when ratio deviates by +/-0.3 from target)
  - Example: Triggers at <0.2 (bridge to Base) or >0.8 (bridge to Alpaca)
  - Minimum rebalancing amount: e.g., $5000 to avoid frequent small transfers

##### Trigger Events

When thresholds crossed AND minimum amounts met, InventoryView emits:

- `EquityImbalanceDetected { symbol, direction: Mint/Redeem, quantity,
  estimated_value_usd }`
- `UsdcImbalanceDetected { direction: AlpacaToBase/BaseToAlpaca, amount }`

The trigger reacts to these events by enqueueing the matching transfer job
(`TransferEquityToMarketMaking`, `TransferEquityToHedging`,
`TransferUsdcToMarketMaking`, or `TransferUsdcToHedging`), whose worker drives
the TokenizedEquityMint, EquityRedemption, or UsdcRebalance aggregate.

##### Example Scenarios

1. **Heavy onchain trading in AAPL**: Sold lots of AAPL tokens onchain, now 85%
   of AAPL inventory is offchain shares
   - Trigger: Mint AAPL (shares -> tokens) to rebalance back toward 50/50

2. **Depleted onchain USDC**: Bought lots of tokens with USDC, now only 15% of
   USDC is onchain
   - Trigger: Bridge USDC from Alpaca to Base to replenish trading capital

3. **Mixed symbol imbalances**: AAPL 80% onchain, MSFT 25% onchain
   - Trigger: Redeem AAPL (tokens -> shares) AND Mint MSFT (shares -> tokens)
   - Each symbol rebalances independently

#### Coordination with Position Aggregate

**Position Aggregate** tracks net exposure from arbitrage trading but does NOT
know about cross-venue inventory.

**InventoryView** listens to:

- `PositionEvent::OnChainOrderFilled` - Updates available balances (trading
  activity)
- `PositionEvent::OffChainOrderFilled` - Updates available balances (trading
  activity)
- `TokenizedEquityMintEvent::MintAccepted` - Moves shares to inflight (leaving
  Alpaca)
- `TokenizedEquityMintEvent::TokensReceived` - Moves from inflight to Raindex
  available
- `TokenizedEquityMintEvent::TokensWrapped` - No balance change (conversion
  between wrapped/unwrapped forms)
- `TokenizedEquityMintEvent::WrappingFailed` - No balance change (tokens await
  retry)
- `TokenizedEquityMintEvent::DepositedIntoRaindex` - No balance change
  (completes transfer to Raindex, already counted at TokensReceived)
- `TokenizedEquityMintEvent::RaindexDepositFailed` - No balance change (tokens
  await retry or manual recovery)
- `TokenizedEquityMintEvent::MintRejected` - No balance change (rejected before
  shares left Alpaca)
- `TokenizedEquityMintEvent::MintAcceptanceFailed` - When emitted after
  `MintAccepted`, reconciles the started inflight back to Alpaca available. When
  emitted by an operator force-fail from `MintRequested` (pre-acceptance), no
  inflight was ever started, so there is no balance change
- `EquityRedemptionEvent::WithdrawnFromRaindex` - Moves tokens to inflight
  (leaving Raindex vault)
- `EquityRedemptionEvent::TokensUnwrapped` - Exact-match unwraps, including
  non-yield-bearing wrappers, cause no balance change (wrapped/unwrapped
  conversion only). For yield-bearing wrappers where NAV appreciation makes the
  unwrapped amount exceed the tracked quantity, `set_inflight` replaces inflight
  with the actual unwrapped amount while `available` remains unchanged; only a
  shortfall cancels the difference back to available
- `EquityRedemptionEvent::TransferFailed` - Cancels inflight back to Raindex
  available (tokens never left our wallet)
- `EquityRedemptionEvent::TokensSent` - Tokens sent to Alpaca (still inflight)
- `EquityRedemptionEvent::Completed` - Moves from inflight to Alpaca available
- `EquityRedemptionEvent::DetectionFailed` - Terminal: tokens may be stranded
  mid-redemption (sent to the issuance bot's redemption wallet but not yet
  settled back as broker shares; manual recovery). Inflight is not held
  indefinitely -- the redemption is dropped from active ownership, so
  inflight-equity polls stop counting its still-pending provider request as
  bot-owned and the inflight clears, letting rebalancing resume; the
  transfer-timeout path also clears inflight explicitly
- `EquityRedemptionEvent::RedemptionRejected` - Terminal: token disposition
  uncertain after rejection. Inflight is released the same way as
  `DetectionFailed` (ownership dropped so polls stop counting the stranded
  request and rebalancing resumes), while operators resolve the actual asset
  location manually
- Failed equity transfer detail views surface the stranded quantity when the
  terminal failure happened after equity left the bot's normal available
  balance. Operators can run a targeted re-check command for a specific failed
  mint or redemption aggregate; if the tokenization provider now reports the
  request completed, the aggregate records recovery events and transitions to
  the same success terminal as the normal flow. Pending, rejected, or missing
  provider requests leave the aggregate unchanged. Recovery runs in-process via
  the bot's REST API (`POST /transfers/recheck/<kind>/<id>`) so the recovery
  event dispatches through the inventory reactor (applying the same inventory
  effect as the successful flow) under the shared resume lock. Mint recovery
  applies only to acceptance-stage failures (tokens never received); a mint that
  failed after receiving tokens is reported as not recoverable so recovery never
  re-wraps tokens that already moved.
- `UsdcRebalanceEvent::WithdrawalConfirmed` - Moves USDC to inflight (leaving
  source)
- `UsdcRebalanceEvent::DepositConfirmed` - Terminal success for AlpacaToBase;
  moves from inflight to destination available
- `UsdcRebalanceEvent::ConversionConfirmed` - Terminal success for BaseToAlpaca;
  moves from inflight to destination available
- `UsdcRebalanceEvent::WithdrawalFailed`, pre-burn `BridgingFailed`, and
  AlpacaToBase `ConversionFailed` (the pre-withdrawal USD->USDC leg) -
  Reconciles inflight back to source available, because the failure happened
  before the CCTP burn so the funds are still on the source venue
- Post-burn `UsdcRebalanceEvent::BridgingFailed`, `DepositFailed`, and
  BaseToAlpaca `ConversionFailed` (the post-deposit USDC->USD leg) - Keeps
  source inflight and the USDC rebalancing guard active because the funds were
  burned (and, for the deposit/conversion failures, already minted) by CCTP and
  are not available on the source venue. The same applies to any transfer that
  times out at or after the burn
- `InventorySnapshotEvent::OnchainEquity` - Onchain equity balances fetched from
  vaults
- `InventorySnapshotEvent::OnchainCash` - Onchain USDC balance fetched from
  vault
- `InventorySnapshotEvent::OffchainEquity` - Offchain equity positions fetched
  from broker
- `InventorySnapshotEvent::OffchainCash` - Offchain cash balance fetched from
  broker
- `InventorySnapshotEvent::InflightEquity` - Bot-owned pending tokenization
  requests polled from Alpaca; sets inflight at Hedging (mints) and MarketMaking
  (redemptions)
  - **Ownership**: determined by active rebalancing aggregate IDs --
    `issuer_request_id` / `tokenization_request_id` for mints,
    `tokenization_request_id` / `redemption_tx` for redemptions -- not by
    destination wallet alone
  - **Pre-detection redemptions**: redemptions that sent tokens before Alpaca
    assigned a `tokenization_request_id` are owned via `redemption_tx` until
    detection records the provider ID
  - **External requests**: unknown pending requests targeting the bot wallet are
    logged for operators but do not count as inflight or block rebalancing
  - **Available balances**: unchanged -- set by separate available-balance
    snapshots

##### Separation of concerns

- Position: Tracks trading-induced position changes
- CrossVenueEquityTransfer: Tracks rebalancing-induced equity movements (mint
  and redemption)
- CrossVenueCashTransfer: Tracks rebalancing-induced USDC movements
- InventoryView: Combines all events to calculate total inventory
- InventorySnapshot: Records fetched balances from onchain vaults and offchain
  broker

##### Inventory Reconciliation

The system's internal accounting is built from events it knows about (trades,
mints, redemptions, USDC rebalances). But inventory can be affected by actions
outside the system - manual deposits, withdrawals, or trades on either venue.
Until those external changes are observed and fed back as events, the internal
accounting drifts from reality.

The reconciliation system closes this gap by periodically fetching actual
balances and emitting them as events the system can react to:

- **VaultRegistry** (CQRS aggregate): Auto-discovers Raindex vaults from
  ClearV3/TakeOrderV3 trade events. Tracks multiple equity vaults per token
  address and multiple USDC vaults per orderbook/owner pair. Startup config
  seeding registers every configured vault, then explicitly marks the first
  entry in the configured vault list (config file order) for each asset as the
  operational primary used by deposit/withdraw/rebalancing paths. Re-running the
  bot after a vault ID config change must move the primary to the new configured
  vault while retaining the retired vault in the registry for balance polling.
- **InventorySnapshot** (CQRS aggregate): Records point-in-time snapshots of
  actual balances fetched from onchain vaults and the offchain broker.
- **InventoryPollingService**: Periodically polls actual balances from both
  venues, emitting InventorySnapshot events. InventoryView reacts to these
  events to update tracked inventory. Offchain equity polling normalizes active
  configured equities omitted by the broker positions response to explicit zero
  balances, and ignores broker-only symbols that are not configured as active
  assets. Onchain polling sums all registered vaults for each asset and warns
  when a registered vault that is no longer present in current config still has
  a positive balance, so stranded funds are visible without sending new
  rebalancing transfers to the retired vault.
- **Polling runs on a 60-second interval** during market hours as a background
  conductor task. Onchain polling uses the `vaultBalance2` contract call;
  offchain polling uses the `Executor::get_inventory()` trait method.

### InventoryView

`InventoryView` aggregates inventory across onchain and offchain venues and
detects imbalances that trigger rebalancing. It is the central projection that
monitors total system inventory.

Each asset type (equities per symbol, USDC) is tracked via a generic
`Inventory<T>` containing `Option<VenueBalance<T>>` per venue. The `Option`
distinguishes "not yet polled" from "polled with zero balance" — imbalance
detection requires both venues to have been initialized by snapshot events.

When `InventoryView` applies an equity snapshot (`OnchainEquity` for the
MarketMaking venue, `OffchainEquity` for the Hedging venue), it treats the
snapshot as the complete picture of that venue: any symbol already tracked at
the venue but absent from the snapshot is zeroed at that venue, subject to the
same staleness guards (snapshot watermark, inflight transfers, last
rebalancing). This keeps the live view consistent with the fully-replaced
persisted snapshot rather than retaining a stale balance. It relies on both
pollers emitting complete venue snapshots: offchain polling seeds an explicit
zero for every configured symbol (above), and onchain polling emits a balance
for every discovered vault in the monotonic vault registry.

`InventoryView` listens to trading events (onchain/offchain fills),
`TokenizedEquityMintEvent`, `EquityRedemptionEvent`, `UsdcRebalanceEvent`, and
`InventorySnapshotEvent` to maintain venue balances. Inflight tracking ensures
assets in transit (minting, redeeming, bridging) are accounted for.

Imbalance detection compares each asset's onchain ratio against a configurable
`ImbalanceThreshold` (target ratio + deviation). Rebalancing is only triggered
when no inflight operations exist for the asset. The trigger enqueues the
matching transfer job for execution.

#### Failure Handling and Reconciliation

**Automatic Reconciliation**: When rebalancing operations fail before assets
leave the recoverable source side, the projection logic reconciles inflight
balances back to the source venue's available balance. Failures after an
irreversible handoff (for example, a CCTP burn) stay inflight until settlement
or manual operator recovery.

**Durable rebalancing guard**: The single-rebalance guard that blocks a new USDC
rebalance while one is unsettled is reconstructed from persisted `UsdcRebalance`
event state on startup, so a restart between a post-burn failure and settlement
cannot re-open the re-burn window. Any aggregate not in a clearable-terminal
state (success, or a pre-burn failure that reconciles to source) re-asserts the
guard at boot and blocks new USDC rebalancing until it settles or an operator
recovers it. Supported stranded states are re-armed with idempotent transfer
jobs on startup; unsupported states keep the guard held and page the operator
for manual recovery.

**Operator recovery of a pre-burn stranded guard latch**: A USDC rebalance can
become stranded in `WithdrawalComplete` (pre-bridging, no burn intent recorded)
or `BridgingSubmitting` (burn intent recorded) if the bot crashes or the burn
fails before the `BridgingInitiated` event is persisted.

`WithdrawalComplete` is pre-CCTP-burn: no burn has been broadcast. However, the
source withdrawal has already completed and the USDC is sitting in the
market-maker wallet awaiting bridging. After clearing the guard with this
command, the operator must reconcile or handle those funds separately.

`BridgingSubmitting` records burn intent but does NOT guarantee that no burn was
broadcast. A crash at this state may have already submitted a CCTP burn whose
`BridgingInitiated` event never persisted (see "Crash-safe resume" above, which
describes `find_recent_burn` scanning for exactly this case). The operator MUST
verify on-chain that no recent CCTP burn left the market-maker wallet before
using `fail-usdc-transfer` on a `BridgingSubmitting` transfer. Using it when a
burn was already broadcast will strand the burned funds.

The `fail-usdc-transfer` CLI command sends `FailBridging { reason }`, which
emits `BridgingFailed { burn_tx_hash: None, cctp_nonce: None }`. Because this is
a pre-burn `BridgingFailed`, `holds_rebalance_guard()` returns false (no burn tx
recorded), and the guard is NOT re-latched on the next startup. The command is
valid ONLY from `BridgingSubmitting` or `WithdrawalComplete` -- it is refused
for all post-burn states (`Bridging`, `AwaitingAttestation`, `Attested`,
`Bridged`, `DepositInitiated`, `DepositConfirmed`, `DepositFailed`,
`Reconciled`, or any `BridgingFailed` with a recorded `burn_tx_hash`). The live
in-memory guard is NOT cleared without a restart: `recover_usdc_guard` on boot
skips non-guard-holding aggregates, so automatic USDC rebalancing resumes on the
next restart.

**Operator reconciliation of a stranded post-burn failure**: A USDC rebalance
that fails after the CCTP burn holds the rebalancing guard, blocking further
USDC rebalancing. Because the burned/minted USDC was handled out-of-band, this
is reconciled rather than re-driven: the `transfer reconcile` CLI command sends
`ReconcileStuckRebalance`, which emits `OperatorReconciled` and drives the
aggregate to a new clearing terminal state, `Reconciled`. The in-progress guard
then clears via one of two paths: (1) the live reactor processes
`OperatorReconciled` directly (if the server itself ran the store command) and
clears the guard, tracking, and source-venue inflight immediately; or (2) the
CLI ran in a separate process, so the live reactor never sees the event -- in
that case the periodic timeout sweep re-derives the durable state on its next
tick, finds `Reconciled`, applies the source-venue inflight reconciliation with
**post-burn semantics** (zeroing source-venue inflight WITHOUT crediting
`available`, because the funds already left the source venue -- it is NOT a
cancel, which would wrongly credit available), and clears the guard. No restart
is required. The command is valid ONLY from a post-burn terminal failure that
strands the guard: `DepositFailed` (the CCTP mint landed but the destination
deposit failed), a post-burn `BridgingFailed` (a `burn_tx_hash` is recorded), or
a `BaseToAlpaca` `ConversionFailed` (the post-deposit USDC->USD leg). Every
other state is rejected -- an in-progress transfer must be resumed, and a
pre-burn failure already reconciles to source on its own. Because `Reconciled`
is a clearable terminal, a restart does not re-latch the guard, and automatic
USDC rebalancing resumes.

Reconcile also applies to the equity transfer aggregates (`TokenizedEquityMint`,
`EquityRedemption`): a mint or redemption stuck in its `Failed` terminal whose
residue was handled out-of-band (e.g. via `wrap-equity` / `vault-deposit`) is
declared resolved by sending the `Reconcile { reason }` command, which emits
`OperatorReconciled` and drives the aggregate to a terminal `Reconciled` state.
Unlike USDC, the equity aggregates hold no in-progress guard, so the `Reconcile`
command emits **no reactor effect and dispatches no inventory update** -- it is
a pure bookkeeping terminal transition. One nuance for redemptions: a redemption
that ended in `DetectionFailed` / `RedemptionRejected` has its stranded exposure
seeded into live inflight at startup (see `symbols_with_stuck_redemptions`).
Reconcile moves the latest event to `OperatorReconciled`, so that redemption is
no longer seeded as stuck on the **next** restart; the running process's live
inflight retains the startup-seeded amount until then. Mint failures and
pre-send redemption failures settle inventory at failure time, so they need no
such clearing. `Reconciled` is valid ONLY from `Failed`; every other state is
rejected. The `Reconciled` state retains the identifying fields (symbol,
quantity, original failure reason, request/redemption identifiers) so the
dashboard projection still reports the real transfer, and maps to a distinct
terminal `Reconciled` DTO status carrying `reconciled_at`, `failure_reason`, and
`reconcile_reason` -- distinguishable from genuine success (`Completed`) at the
DTO level. The CLI surface is `transfer reconcile --kind mint|redemption`
(alongside `--kind usdc`).

The operator-facing verb vocabulary that this command and the rest of the
recovery CLI follow is defined in the "Operator Recovery Surface" section below.

##### Manual Reconciliation Required

Some failure scenarios may leave assets in states requiring manual intervention:

1. **Redemption sent but Alpaca never recognizes**:
   - Tokens successfully sent to redemption wallet (TokensSent)
   - Alpaca API never shows the redemption request
   - Tokens are neither in our orderbook vault nor credited to Alpaca
   - **Resolution**: Contact Alpaca support with tx_hash to manually credit
     shares

2. **CCTP bridge stuck**:
   - USDC burned on source chain (BridgingInitiated)
   - Attestation retrieval fails or mint transaction repeatedly fails
   - USDC is neither on source nor destination chain
   - Attestation poll _timeouts_ are retried automatically until
     `attestation_retry_deadline_secs`; manual reconciliation is only needed
     after the deadline elapses (BridgingFailed) or on a hard mint failure
   - **Resolution**: Retry attestation fetching or mint transaction with
     extended timeout

3. **Mint accepted but tokens never arrive**:
   - Shares taken from Alpaca (MintAccepted)
   - Issuer/bridge never completes the mint
   - Shares gone but tokens not received
   - **Resolution**: Contact issuer/bridge provider to complete or reverse
     transaction

**Future Enhancement**: Add a `ReconciliationAggregate` to track manual
interventions as first-class events:

```rust
enum ReconciliationCommand {
    ReportStuckRedemption { redeem_id: Uuid, recovery_plan: String },
    ResolveStuckRedemption { redeem_id: Uuid, resolution: Resolution },
    // Similar commands for mint and USDC rebalancing
}

enum Resolution {
    ManuallyCompleted { supporting_evidence: String },
    ManuallyCancelled { refund_tx: Option<TxHash> },
}
```

This would provide complete audit trail for all manual interventions and allow
proper tracking of asset movements that required manual resolution.

### Operator Recovery Surface

The CLI exposes operator commands for recovering stuck or failed operations.
These commands share one vocabulary so each command's intent is unambiguous.
This section is the source of truth for that vocabulary. The grouped command
surface is the only operator recovery interface; the pre-rename flat command
names were removed with no back-compat.

**Commands are grouped by the object they act on:**

- `transfer` -- cross-venue mint, redemption, and USDC-rebalance operations.
- `position` -- the long-lived per-symbol Position aggregate.
- `view` -- materialized read-side projections.
- `cctp` -- raw wallet-level CCTP bridge primitives (touch no aggregate).

**Each command uses exactly one of six verbs (one verb = one intent), with two
named exemptions defined after the list:**

- `resume` -- drive an interrupted, non-terminal operation forward along its
  normal path. Never forces a transition and is idempotent against double-spend.
  Realized per-id for USDC transfers (`--kind usdc`) and as a bulk resume of ALL
  interrupted mints and redemptions for equity (`--kind equity`, via the running
  bot's REST API; each transfer succeeds or fails independently).
- `recheck` -- re-query the external provider for ground truth and apply it; may
  un-fail a terminal `Failed` operation or resume a non-terminal one along its
  normal path. Requires the running bot (REST). Realized today for equity mints
  and redemptions only; USDC rebalances have no provider recheck (use `resume`
  while non-terminal, `reconcile` after a post-burn terminal failure).
- `fail` -- force a stuck non-terminal operation to its clean `Failed` terminal
  so the system stops waiting on it; `--reason` required.
- `reconcile` -- declare an already-terminal-failed operation resolved
  out-of-band. For the USDC realization this releases the guard and inflight
  accounting the failed state stranded; it applies once funds have left the
  source venue, whether stuck in transit or failed after arrival, while a
  pre-departure failure strands nothing and needs no reconcile. For the equity
  realization (`mint`/`redemption`) the `Failed` state holds no guard or
  surviving inflight, so reconcile is a pure bookkeeping terminal transition
  declaring the residue -- already handled out-of-band -- resolved; `--reason`
  required.
- `set` -- overwrite aggregate-derived state to an operator-asserted value, with
  a mandatory audit reason.
- `rebuild` -- recompute a projection from the event log; emits no events.

Three commands sit deliberately outside the six-verb set, named for their exact
effect rather than a generic intent:

- `cctp complete-mint` -- the `cctp` group exposes raw on-chain primitives that
  touch no aggregate, so its commands are named for the on-chain action they
  perform and are exempt from the recovery-verb vocabulary.
- `position release-hedge` -- release a Position's stuck pending-offchain-order
  pointer so normal hedging can retry; it replaced the removed
  `fail-pending-offchain-order` command. `fail` would be the wrong verb here:
  the Position itself never fails -- only its orphaned order does; `--reason`
  required.
- `process-tx` -- account an onchain fill the bot never recorded, given its
  transaction hash: it witnesses the fill into the `OnChainTrade` log,
  acknowledges it on the `Position`, and places the opposite-side hedge, running
  the same `witness -> enrich -> acknowledge -> mark -> settle` exactly-once
  sequence as the automated pipeline (see ADR 0005 and ADR 0010). Unlike the two
  commands above it belongs to no object group -- there is no stuck aggregate to
  recover, only a missing fill to backfill. It **fails closed on a fill already
  recorded** in the `OnChainTrade` log, whether acknowledged or merely
  witnessed: re-applying it would double-count the position, so only a fill with
  no record is accounted. It runs in direct-DB mode and **must not run while the
  bot is concurrently accounting the same symbol** -- the CLI and the bot are
  separate processes that no in-process lock can serialize, so the persisted
  pending-acknowledgement set (see ADR 0010), not process isolation, is what
  makes a cross-process re-drive reject as a duplicate rather than double-count.

**Standing rules:**

- **All state-mutating recovery commands go through the CQRS aggregate-command
  flow.** The CLI sends an aggregate command through the store, which routes it
  to the aggregate's command handler to emit events; no recovery command writes
  the `events` table directly. The non-mutating verb `rebuild` and the exempt
  `cctp` group never touch the events table either: `rebuild` recomputes a
  read-side projection from the existing event log, and `cctp` commands are pure
  on-chain operations with no aggregate -- which is precisely why `reconcile`
  exists to bring the aggregate back in sync after an out-of-band `cctp` action.
- **`recover` is not a CLI verb.** It historically meant three different things
  (raw mint completion, provider-truth un-failing, and on-chain mint adoption),
  so it carries no information. The raw bridge primitive is named
  `cctp complete-mint`; the legacy `cctp-recover` name has been removed.
- **Execution mode is part of each command's contract.** Help text states which
  mode the command uses: direct-DB (the operator must ensure the bot is not
  concurrently driving the same id); direct-DB plus a live RPC provider
  (`transfer resume --kind usdc` drives the on-chain flow against the local
  aggregate store, with the same no-concurrent-bot caveat); live RPC only
  (`cctp complete-mint` touches no database state -- the caveat is the bot
  concurrently driving the same on-chain mint); or the running bot (REST).
  `recheck` and `transfer resume --kind equity` are the only commands that
  require the bot.
- **`--reason` MUST be required, with no default, on every event-emitting
  destructive verb** (`fail`, `reconcile`, `set`, and `position release-hedge`).
  A defaulted reason is an audit-hostile record and violates the
  no-silent-defaults rule. Earlier transitional steps carried defaulted reasons
  on now-removed legacy command names; with those names deleted, every grouped
  destructive verb requires an explicit `--reason`, and a present-but-blank
  value is rejected at parse time. `reconcile --kind usdc` additionally
  constrains its reason to a fixed vocabulary (`funds-moved-manually` /
  `deposit-credited-offline`); `mint`/`redemption` reconcile reasons are free
  text.
- **`fail` and `reconcile` are distinct and must not be conflated.** `fail` is
  for an operation the system is still waiting on (force it to a clean
  terminal); `reconcile` is for an operation that already failed and whose guard
  must clear because the funds were handled out-of-band. The USDC
  `ReconcileStuckRebalance` command (see above) is the first realization of the
  `reconcile` verb.
- **`process-tx` implements the ADR-0005 exactly-once fill accounting
  protocol.** It fails closed (with a clear operator message) if the fill is
  already acknowledged, resumes if it was witnessed but not yet acknowledged
  (crash- recovery window), and creates the full witness/acknowledge record for
  genuinely missed fills — so every subsequent re-delivery, whether from another
  CLI run or the normal pipeline, hits the dedup guard and skips cleanly.
  **Operational precondition**: run with exclusive processing for that fill:
  stop the live bot, drain any apalis accounting job for the fill, and do not
  run another `process-tx` for the same `(tx_hash, log_index)` concurrently. The
  durable dedup guard and the CQRS apply are separate transactions, so any
  concurrent actor processing the same fill can slip through the TOCTOU window.

### Event Processing Flow

#### OnChain Event Processing

**Current Flow** (apalis-orchestrated with CQRS/ES):

```mermaid

    participant BC as Blockchain
    participant OFM as OrderFillMonitor
    participant Q as Job Queue (apalis/SQLite)
    participant W as Trade Accountant Worker
    participant P as Position Aggregate
    participant OO as OffchainOrder Aggregate
    participant Broker as Broker API
    participant OP as Order Poller

    BC->>OFM: ClearV3/TakeOrderV3 event (WebSocket)
    OFM->>Q: Push AccountForDexTrade job

    W->>Q: Pull next job
    W->>W: Convert event to OnchainTrade
    W->>W: Discover and register vaults
    W->>P: AcknowledgeOnChainFill
    alt Threshold met
        W->>OO: Place offchain order
        OO->>Broker: Execute market order
    end

    loop Poll Orders
        OP->>Broker: Get order status
        Broker-->>OP: Order filled
        OP->>OO: CompleteFill
        OP->>P: CompleteOffChainOrder
    end
```

On startup, backfill pushes historical events after the persisted backfill
checkpoint as `AccountForDexTrade` jobs into the same queue. The worker starts
after backfill completes, so historical jobs are enqueued before live events are
processed. Successful backfill advances the checkpoint to the cutoff block.

The diagram above shows `ClearV3`/`TakeOrderV3`, the direct-orderbook fill
source. In `managed` inventory mode, `OperatorDeposit`/`OperatorWithdraw`
settlement pairs on the shared `RaindexInventory` are a third fill source pushed
into the same `AccountForDexTrade` queue as an `InventoryTrade`; see
"InventoryTrade: a third fill source" above for the pairing rules.

#### Orchestration Job Taxonomy

All work managed by the Conductor falls into one of these categories:

**Finite jobs** (one-shot, durable, processed from SQLite queue):

| Job                      | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `AccountForDexTrade`     | Convert raindex event, discover vaults, acknowledge fill, place hedge     |
| `DiscoverVaultsForTrade` | Extract and register vault info from trade event (no ordering constraint) |
| `EnrichTrade`            | Add pyth pricing and gas metadata to OnChainTrade aggregate               |
| Backfill                 | Fetch historical events, push as `AccountForDexTrade` jobs                |
| Seed vault registry      | Populate known vaults from config at startup                              |
| Rebalancing operation    | Execute a cross-venue asset transfer (mint/redeem/bridge)                 |

**Long-running services** (streaming, restart on failure):

| Service             | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Order fill monitor  | Polls ClearV3/TakeOrderV3 and inventory OperatorDeposit/OperatorWithdraw settlements, pushes trade jobs |
| Rebalancing trigger | Detects inventory imbalances, pushes rebalancing jobs                                                   |

**Scheduled jobs** (periodic, future — currently long-running with sleep loops):

| Job                  | Interval | Description                                          |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Inventory poll       | ~30s     | Poll vault + broker balances, broadcast to dashboard |
| Order status poll    | ~10s     | Poll broker for pending order fills                  |
| Position check       | ~60s     | Reconcile accumulated positions (safety net)         |
| Executor maintenance | ~15m     | Refresh broker metadata, check asset availability    |

**Lifecycle workflows** (stepped, durable, future):

| Workflow           | Steps                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trade lifecycle    | convert -> discover_vaults -> acknowledge_fill -> place_hedge -> await_fill -> confirm |
| Equity rebalancing | plan_transfer -> execute_onchain -> await_confirmations -> reconcile                   |
| USDC rebalancing   | plan_bridge -> execute_bridge -> await_confirmations -> reconcile                      |

#### Manager Pattern

The current implementation uses a flat job model where `AccountForDexTrade`
performs the full trade pipeline in a single `perform()` call. As the system
evolves toward lifecycle workflows, the pipeline steps will become discrete
workflow steps coordinated by apalis-workflow, with each step as a durable
checkpoint.

#### Future Consideration: Reorg Handling

**Note**: Reorg handling is not implemented currently, but the event-sourced
architecture will make it significantly easier to add in the future.

Blockchain reorganizations occur before block finalization. When we eventually
implement reorg handling, the event-sourced architecture will make it
significantly easier than the current CRUD approach.

##### Why Event Sourcing Helps

Simply append a reorg event that reverses the position change. The event would
be: PositionCommand::RecordReorg with tx_hash, log_index, symbol, amount,
direction, reorg_depth. The resulting PositionEvent::Reorged would reverse the
original trade's position impact. Views would update automatically. The
`onchain_trade_view` could mark trades as `reorged: true` without deleting them.

##### Benefits (when implemented)

- Append-only: no cascading updates across tables
- Complete audit trail: preserves both original trade and reorg event
- Testable: Given-When-Then testing for reorg scenarios
- Recoverable: fix bugs and replay events to correct state
- Explicit: reorgs are first-class domain events, not special cases

This demonstrates how the event-sourced architecture provides a cleaner
foundation for future enhancements.

### Testing Strategy

#### Aggregate Testing

Use `TestHarness` for BDD-style command testing and `replay` for reconstructing
state from events. Both operate at the `EventSourced` level, hiding
`Lifecycle`/`Aggregate` internals:

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_position_accumulates_fills() {
    let events = TestHarness::<Position>::with(())
        .given(vec![
            PositionEvent::Initialized { /* ... */ },
            PositionEvent::OnChainOrderFilled { /* ... */ },
        ])
        .when(PositionCommand::AcknowledgeOnChainFill { /* ... */ })
        .await
        .then_expect_events(&[
            PositionEvent::OnChainOrderFilled { /* ... */ },
        ]);
}
```

#### State Reconstruction Testing

Use `replay` to reconstruct entity state from a sequence of events:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_replay_builds_position_state() {
    let position = replay::<Position>(vec![
        PositionEvent::Initialized { /* ... */ },
        PositionEvent::OnChainOrderFilled { /* ... */ },
    ])
    .unwrap()
    .expect("should produce a live position");

    assert_eq!(position.net, FractionalShares::new(dec!(1.5)));
}
```

#### Integration Testing

```rust
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_full_flow_blockchain_to_broker() {
    // Setup test pool and CQRS instances
    // Execute commands across aggregates
    // Verify events persisted and views updated
}
```

### Code Organization

Aggregates use flat file structure by default. Submodules are only introduced
when natural business logic boundaries emerge (e.g., `alpaca_broker_api/` splits
auth, client, order, and positions because broker integration has distinct
business concerns).

## Admin Dashboard

### Overview

A web-based admin dashboard for monitoring and controlling the liquidity bot
from a single interface. The dashboard consolidates system health, trading
activity, P&L metrics, and operational controls without duplicating
functionality already available in Grafana.

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: SvelteKit with Svelte 5 (runes, snippets)
- **UI Components**: shadcn-svelte
- **Charts**: TradingView Lightweight Charts for financial visualizations
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack Query v6 (svelte-query with runes support)
- **Grafana**: Embedded iframes for detailed metrics dashboards
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Language**: TypeScript

### TypeScript Patterns

#### Tagged Unions for Domain Modeling

Following the same ADT philosophy used in the Rust backend, the dashboard uses
discriminated unions (tagged unions) for type-safe domain modeling:

```typescript
// Domain types
type Position =
  | { status: "empty"; symbol: string }
  | {
    status: "active";
    symbol: string;
    net: number;
    pendingExecutionId?: string;
  };

// API errors
type ApiError =
  | { tag: "network"; message: string }
  | { tag: "unauthorized" }
  | { tag: "not_found"; resource: string }
  | { tag: "server"; status: number; message: string };

// Result type
type Result<T, E> =
  | { ok: true; value: T }
  | { ok: false; error: E };
```

#### Custom FP Helpers Module

A small `lib/fp.ts` module provides utility functions for working with Result
types and tagged unions:

- `ok<T>(value: T)` / `err<E>(error: E)` - Result constructors
- `match(union, handlers)` - Exhaustive pattern matching
- `pipe(value, ...fns)` - Left-to-right function composition
- `map`, `flatMap`, `mapErr` - Result transformations

No external dependencies - keeps bundle small and avoids library lock-in.

#### Alternatives Considered

- **Effect**: Full-featured FP library with structured concurrency, dependency
  injection, and comprehensive error handling. Rejected as overkill for a
  dashboard - adds ~50kb+ and significant conceptual overhead. Would shine for
  complex async orchestration but this is mostly "fetch and display".

- **neverthrow**: Lightweight Result/ResultAsync library (~2kb). Considered for
  typed error handling but adds friction with TanStack Query (expects throwing
  promises). Hand-rolled Result type provides 80% of the benefit with zero
  dependencies.

- **Plain fetch + Svelte stores**: Simplest approach but requires manual
  caching, retry logic, and background refetch. TanStack Query handles this
  better.

#### State Management

- **Server state**: TanStack Query v6 as reactive cache, populated via WebSocket
- **Local UI state**: Svelte 5 `$state` and `$derived` runes

#### WebSocket-First Data Flow

All read data flows through a single WebSocket connection:

1. Client connects to `WS /api/ws`
2. Server sends full initial state as first message (positions, trades, P&L,
   circuit breaker state)
3. Server streams incremental updates as events occur

##### Benefits

- Single connection to manage
- No race condition between HTTP fetch and WebSocket updates
- Server controls exactly what state the client starts with
- HTTP endpoints only needed for mutations (circuit breaker)

##### Message Types

Message types (`ServerMessage`, `InitialState`, etc.) are defined in the
`st0x-dto` crate (`crates/dto/src/lib.rs`) and auto-generated as TypeScript
types via `ts-rs`. The DTO crate is the source of truth for all wire formats.

##### TanStack Query Integration

WebSocket messages populate the TanStack Query cache. Each `ServerMessage`
variant maps to one or more query keys (e.g., `["trades"]`, `["inventory"]`,
`["transfers", "active"]`). The `initial` message seeds all caches on
connection; subsequent messages update individual caches incrementally.

### Core Features

#### Grafana Dashboard Embedding

Embed existing Grafana dashboards directly in the admin UI:

- Configure Grafana for anonymous viewer access (already supported)
- Embed dashboards via iframe with time range synchronization
- Dashboard selector for switching between different views (overview, trades,
  P&L)
- Fallback UI when Grafana is unavailable

No need to rebuild Grafana's visualization capabilities - leverage existing
dashboards.

#### HyperDX Health Status

Display service health from HyperDX:

- Fetch health metrics via HyperDX API
- Display health status badge in dashboard header
- Show recent alerts and error counts
- Link to full HyperDX dashboard for detailed investigation

```typescript
// HyperDX API integration
const response = await fetch("https://api.hyperdx.io/api/v1/alerts", {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${HYPERDX_API_KEY}` },
});
```

#### Circuit Breaker

Emergency control to halt all trading activity:

- Prominent toggle in dashboard header (always visible)
- Confirmation dialog before triggering
- Displays current status: active/tripped with timestamp and reason
- When tripped: bot stops placing new hedge orders
- Existing positions preserved (no forced liquidation)
- Manual reset required to resume trading

##### Implementation

- New database table or flag to track circuit breaker state
- Bot checks flag before placing any broker orders
- API endpoints for trigger/reset/status

```text
GET  /api/circuit-breaker/status
POST /api/circuit-breaker/trigger  { reason: string }
POST /api/circuit-breaker/reset
```

### Dashboard Layout

Single-page dashboard with live-updating panels, each expandable to full-screen.
It presents the current Alpaca-backed runtime rather than switching between
multiple broker-specific contexts.

#### Header Bar

- Circuit breaker status toggle
- WebSocket connection status

#### Panels

1. **Performance Metrics**: Key metrics (AUM, P&L, volume, trade count, Sharpe,
   Sortino, max drawdown, hedge lag, uptime) with timeframe selector (1h, 1d,
   1w, 1m, all-time).

2. **Inventory**: Per-symbol equity holdings and cash balances across venues,
   with available/inflight breakdowns. It also shows wallet-observed inventory
   outside the venues: Ethereum/Base wallet USDC and Base wallet unwrapped
   (`tSTOCK`) vs wrapped (`wtSTOCK`) equity tokens. Includes an "Inventory
   Transfers" section showing active and recent transfer operations with status.

3. **Spreads**: Last realized spreads per asset (buy/sell prices, Pyth
   reference, spread bps) and per-symbol price charts over time.

4. **Trade History**: Recent trades filterable by venue (onchain/offchain/both).

5. **Live Events**: Real-time domain event stream (aggregate type, ID, sequence,
   event type, timestamp). Starts empty, populates via WebSocket.

### Architecture

#### Separate Frontend Package

Dashboard lives in `dashboard/` directory at repository root:

```text
dashboard/
├── src/
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── components/     # Panel components, UI primitives
│   │   ├── api/            # API client and types
│   │   ├── fp.ts           # Result type, match, pipe utilities
│   │   └── websocket.svelte.ts
│   ├── routes/
│   │   ├── +layout.svelte  # App shell with header bar
│   │   └── +page.svelte    # Main dashboard (all panels)
│   └── app.html
├── static/
├── package.json
├── svelte.config.js
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

#### Backend API Extensions

Extend existing Rocket server (`src/api.rs`):

##### WebSocket (all read data)

```text
WS /api/ws
```

Sends initial state on connect, then streams updates. See WebSocket-First Data
Flow section above.

##### Mutations (HTTP, require API key)

```text
POST /api/circuit-breaker/trigger  { reason: string }
POST /api/circuit-breaker/reset
```

#### Authentication

Public read access with authenticated actions:

- **Read endpoints** (positions, trades, P&L, status): No authentication
  required
- **Action endpoints** (circuit breaker trigger/reset): Require API key
- API key sent in `Authorization` header, validated against `DASHBOARD_API_KEY`
  environment variable
- Future: Proper user authentication system with role-based access

#### Deployment

Dashboard is built as a Nix derivation (`st0x-dashboard`) that produces static
assets. Nginx on the NixOS host serves these files and reverse-proxies API
requests to the backend.

### Non-Goals (MVP)

- User authentication system (API key is sufficient for actions)
- Position entry from dashboard (read-only + circuit breaker only)
- Multi-tenant support

### Nice to Have

- Mobile-responsive design (not mobile-first, but usable on mobile - modern
  stack makes this low effort)

## Operational Alerting

The bot raises out-of-band alerts for conditions an operator must react to
quickly. Alerting is **optional**: when its configuration is absent the bot runs
normally with no alert channel and the alert monitors are not spawned.

Worker-circuit signals answer two bounded on-call questions. “Which worker
paused and why?” is answered by the circuit-open transition and its operator
alert. “Did it recover without a process restart?” is answered by the matching
structured recovery transition. Worker names and transition names are bounded
fields; errors remain event details rather than metric labels.

### Gas balance monitoring

The bot pays gas in native ETH for every on-chain transaction (vault ops, CCTP
bridging, token wrapping, hedge rebalancing). If the market-maker wallet runs
dry, those transactions silently stop succeeding. To surface this before it
halts operations, a supervised **gas monitor** watches the wallet's native-ETH
balance.

**Scope.** The monitor watches the order-owner wallet (derived from the
`[wallet]` address) on the orderbook chain — Base in production — using the same
RPC provider the bot already uses for fill polling and contract reads.
Monitoring the Ethereum-mainnet wallet is a follow-up; it would require wiring
the mainnet provider into the conductor.

**Behavior.**

- Every `poll_interval` seconds the monitor reads the wallet's native balance.
- When the balance drops **below** `low_balance_threshold` (a decimal-ETH amount
  parsed to wei at startup — a malformed value fails fast), it raises an alert:
  a structured `error!` log (target `gas`) carrying the wallet, chain, current
  balance and threshold, plus a Telegram notification.
- **De-duplication.** The monitor alerts once on the transition into the low
  state, then re-alerts at most once per `realert_interval` while the balance
  stays low. It never notifies on every poll.
- **Recovery.** When the balance returns to at or above the threshold, the
  monitor emits a single `info!` log and recovery notification, then resets.
- A transient RPC read failure is logged and swallowed (it does not advance the
  de-dup state and does not raise an alert); the supervised task keeps polling.
- **Restart behavior.** The de-dup state is held in memory and resets on
  restart. If the bot restarts while the balance is low, the first poll after
  restart treats the unknown -> low transition as a new threshold crossing and
  alerts immediately, regardless of how recently an alert was sent before the
  restart. Frequent restarts during a prolonged low-balance condition can
  therefore produce alerts more often than `realert_interval` alone would
  suggest.

### Telegram channel

Alerts are delivered to Telegram via the Bot API `sendMessage` endpoint. The
non-secret `[alerts]` config supplies the destination `chat_id`, the
thresholds/intervals, and an optional `message_thread_id`; the encrypted secrets
supply the bot `bot_token`. When `message_thread_id` is set, alerts post into
that forum topic (for topic-enabled supergroups); when omitted they go to the
chat's default topic. When either half (config or secret) is present without the
other, startup fails fast rather than running with a half-configured alert
channel. A notification delivery failure is logged but never crashes the
monitor.

### BaseToAlpaca deposit send

The CCTP mint on the BaseToAlpaca leg sets `mintRecipient` to the bot's own
market-maker wallet on Ethereum, so the minted USDC lands in the bot wallet --
NOT at an Alpaca deposit address. Alpaca credits a deposit only when USDC is
transferred to the per-account deposit address it issues. The deposit leg
therefore performs an explicit fund-moving send:

1. **Fetch the deposit address.** `get_wallet_address(USDC, ethereum)` returns
   Alpaca's per-account Ethereum USDC deposit address.
2. **Send (crash-safe, split fresh vs resume like the CCTP burn).** The fresh
   path (right after this execution minted) sends the ERC20 transfer of the
   received amount from the bot wallet to the deposit address DIRECTLY -- no
   pre-send scan, no finality wait -- since no prior send can exist. The
   resume-from-`Bridged` path (a crash may have left a prior send) first scans
   Ethereum for an already-submitted USDC
   `Transfer(from = bot wallet, to = deposit address, value = amount received)`
   at or after the mint tx's block (the scan lower bound: the deposit send lands
   at or after the mint, so no earlier transfer can be this deposit's). If such
   a transfer exists, it is ADOPTED (no second send); otherwise it sends. A scan
   failure (an RPC error, or an inconclusive finality-gated scan) returns an
   error and sends NOTHING -- never a blind re-send -- so a transient fault
   cannot double-spend.
3. **Record the send.** The send tx (not the mint tx) is recorded as the deposit
   reference via `InitiateDeposit`, advancing the aggregate to
   `DepositInitiated`.
4. **Poll by the send tx.** Alpaca is polled for the deposit identified by the
   send tx until it is credited, then `ConfirmDeposit` is emitted and the
   USDC-to-USD conversion runs.

The resume-path scan is what makes resuming from `Bridged` safe: a crash between
a fresh direct send and `InitiateDeposit` re-enters the leg from `Bridged`,
where the scan finds the already-submitted transfer and adopts it instead of
forwarding the minted USDC twice. Once `InitiateDeposit` is recorded, resume
re-polls by the recorded send tx without sending again.

//! Autonomous mock Alpaca Broker API for E2E tests.
//!
//! Uses `respond_with` dynamic closures backed by shared `Arc<Mutex<MockState>>`
//! so the mock auto-responds based on request content. Tests configure a mode
//! (happy path, rejected, placement fails) and optionally set initial account
//! state via the builder - no per-request mock setup needed.

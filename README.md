# st0x.liquidity

## Overview

Tokenized equity market making system that provides onchain liquidity and
captures arbitrage profits.

- **Onchain Liquidity**: Raindex orders continuously offer to buy/sell tokenized
  equities at spreads around oracle prices
- **Automatic Hedging**: When liquidity is taken onchain, the Rust bot executes
  offsetting trades on traditional brokerages to hedge the change in exposure
- **Profit Capture**: Earns the spread on every trade while hedging directional
  exposure

The system enables efficient price discovery for onchain tokenized equity
markets by providing continuous two-sided liquidity.

## Features

- **Supported Executors**: Execute hedges through Alpaca Broker API (managed
  accounts, auto-rebalancing) or dry-run mode for testing
- **Real-Time Hedging**: WebSocket-based monitoring for near instant execution
  when onchain liquidity is taken
- **Fractional Share Support**: Executes fractional shares on Alpaca; dry-run
  mirrors the same execution model for testing
- **Alpaca Hedge Preflight**: Checks available offchain shares for sells and
  cash buying power for buys (includes unsettled T+1 equity-sale proceeds,
  excludes margin) before submitting Alpaca hedge orders
- **Serialized Counter-Trade Submission**: Within one bot process, queued and
  periodic hedge submissions share a lock and reserve budget against active
  offchain orders before placing new Alpaca counter-trades
- **Complete Audit Trail**: Database tracking linking every onchain trade to
  offchain hedge executions
- **Exposure Hedging**: Automatically executes offsetting trades to reduce
  directional exposure from onchain fills
- **Operator Vault Controls**: CLI supports generic ERC20 deposits to and
  withdrawals from Raindex vaults, with a USDC-specific withdrawal shortcut

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Nix with flakes enabled** - For reproducible development environment
- **[direnv](https://direnv.net/)** (recommended) - The repo includes an
- `.envrc` that automatically loads the Nix dev shell when you `cd` into the
  project. Without direnv, run `nix develop` manually in each terminal

### Development Setup

The Rust build has two compile-time dependencies that must be set up before
`cargo check` will succeed:

1. **Solidity ABI artifacts** - The Rust `sol!` macros reference JSON ABI files
   that are produced by per-feature Nix derivations under `nix/` and exposed via
   `ST0X_*_ABI` environment variables when you enter the dev shell -- no
   submodule checkout or manual `forge build` step required
2. **SQLite database** - The `sqlx::query!` macros validate SQL against a live
   database at compile time

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ST0x-Technology/st0x.liquidity.git
cd st0x.liquidity
direnv allow      # or `nix develop` if not using direnv
sqlx db create    # create SQLite database for sqlx macros
sqlx migrate run  # apply migrations
cargo check       # verify setup
```

Solidity ABIs are produced as per-feature Nix derivations under `nix/`
(`forge-std.nix`, `pyth.nix`, `rain-math-float.nix`, `rain-orderbook.nix`,
`raindex-governance.nix` -- the shared `RaindexInventory` ABI) and exposed to
`cargo` through environment variables set by the dev shell -- no submodule
checkout, no manual `forge build` required.

To reset the database: `sqlx db reset -y`

**AI agents**: For Rust/TypeScript work, run agents inside the dev shell so they
have access to all tooling (e.g., `nix develop -c claude`). For editing Nix
code, a regular shell is fine.

### Configuration

The application uses TOML configuration files split into plaintext config and
encrypted secrets. See `example.config.toml` and `example.secrets.toml` for all
available options. Operational intervals such as
`apalis_finished_job_cleanup_interval_secs` must be explicitly configured and
non-zero.

The `[raindex]` section requires an explicit `inventory_mode` (`"legacy"` or
`"managed"`) and a `vault_owner` address (the on-chain owner the vaults are
keyed by; no fallback). `"managed"` additionally requires an `inventory` address
(the shared `RaindexInventory` the bot operates via `OPERATOR_ROLE`) and is
forbidden from being set under `"legacy"`. See the `[raindex]` block in
`example.config.toml` for the full field documentation.

Current broker support is limited to `alpaca-broker-api` and `dry-run`.

```bash
cargo run --bin server -- --config path/to/config.toml --secrets path/to/secrets.toml
```

Manual wrap of tokenized equity into wrapped vault shares (requires rebalancing
mode and a configured Base liquidity wallet):

```bash
cargo run --bin cli -- --config path/to/config.toml --secrets path/to/secrets.toml wrap-equity --symbol AAPL --quantity 10.5
```

Manual unwrap of wrapped equity shares (requires rebalancing mode and a
configured Base liquidity wallet):

```bash
cargo run --bin cli -- --config path/to/config.toml --secrets path/to/secrets.toml unwrap-equity --symbol AAPL --quantity 10.5
```

Manual repair of local position tracking after an operator trade or rebalance:

```bash
cargo run --bin cli -- --config path/to/config.toml --secrets path/to/secrets.toml position set --symbol SPYM --zero --reason "manual rebalance completed"
cargo run --bin cli -- --config path/to/config.toml --secrets path/to/secrets.toml position set --symbol SPYM --long 100 --price 200 --reason "manual buy not observed by bot"
cargo run --bin cli -- --config path/to/config.toml --secrets path/to/secrets.toml position set --symbol SPYM --short 12.5 --price 200 --reason "manual sell not observed by bot"
```

`--price` (USDC per share) is required for a nonzero target when the symbol uses
a dollar-value execution threshold and no price is already known; without it the
repaired exposure could never be valued and would never hedge.

`position set` is rejected while the symbol still has a pending offchain hedge
order; resolve it first with `position release-hedge`, then retry.

After verifying a missing daily snapshot mark against a historical-price source,
set the preceding regular-session close through the audited CQRS repair command:

```bash
cargo run --bin cli -- --config path/to/config.toml --secrets path/to/secrets.toml portfolio-snapshot set --day 2026-07-20 --symbol AAPL --usd-mark 211.18 --observed-at 2026-07-17T20:00:00Z --source "Nasdaq historical close" --reason "repair missing snapshot mark"
```

The repair updates every captured location for that symbol and day without
changing the live position price. If the read model needs recovery, replay all
captured balances and corrections with
`st0x-cli view rebuild --aggregate
portfolio-snapshot --all`.

### Brokerage Setup

**Alpaca Broker API** (managed accounts, supports auto-rebalancing):

For managed/omnibus accounts. Requires Broker API access from Alpaca. This is
the only integration that supports automatic portfolio rebalancing (USDC/equity
threshold-based).

Add credentials to your TOML config file under the `[broker]` section (see
`example.config.toml` and `example.secrets.toml`). Alpaca configs must also set
`broker.counter_trade_slippage_bps`, which controls the buy-side preflight
buffer in basis points.

## Deployment

The system runs on a NixOS host on DigitalOcean, managed by deploy-rs. All
infrastructure is defined declaratively in Nix and Terraform.

### Architecture

```
GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
  |
  | deploy-rs over SSH
  v
NixOS host (DigitalOcean droplet)
  ├── st0x-hedge       (systemd, hedging bot)
  ├── datasette        (systemd, SQLite database explorer)
  ├── nginx            (dashboard + WebSocket proxy)
  └── grafana          (metrics visualization)
```

Services are deployed as independent nix profiles, allowing per-service updates
and rollbacks without affecting other services.

### Key Files

| File                | Purpose                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `os.nix`            | NixOS system configuration (services, firewall, users) |
| `deploy.nix`        | deploy-rs profiles and deployment wrappers             |
| `rust.nix`          | Nix derivation for Rust binaries                       |
| `keys.nix`          | SSH public keys and role-based access                  |
| `infra/secrets.nix` | ragenix secret declarations                            |
| `secret/*.toml.age` | Encrypted service configs (decrypted at deploy)        |
| `infra/`            | Terraform for DigitalOcean infrastructure              |
| `disko.nix`         | Disk partitioning for nixos-anywhere bootstrap         |

### Deploy Commands

```bash
# Deploy everything (system config + all service binaries)
nix run .#deployAll

# Deploy only NixOS system configuration (SSH, firewall, systemd units, nginx)
nix run .#deployNixos

# Deploy a specific service profile
nix run .#deployService st0x-hedge
nix run .#deployService datasette
```

### SSH Access

```bash
nix run .#remote              # interactive shell
nix run .#remote -- <command> # run a command
```

### Rollback

Each service profile maintains a history of deployments. Rollback requires two
steps: reverting the nix profile, then restarting the affected services (the
profile switch alone does not trigger a restart).

deploy-rs uses legacy (`nix-env`-style) profiles internally.
`nix profile
rollback` is **not compatible** — you must use `nix-env`.

SSH into the host and run:

```bash
# Roll back the bot profile to previous deployment
nix-env --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-service/st0x-hedge --rollback
systemctl restart st0x-hedge

# Roll back the Datasette profile
nix-env --profile /nix/var/nix/profiles/per-service/datasette --rollback
systemctl restart datasette
```

### Secrets Management

Service configs are encrypted with ragenix (age encryption using SSH keys) and
committed to git as `.age` files. The NixOS host decrypts them at activation
using its SSH key, mounting cleartext to `/run/agenix/` (tmpfs).

```bash
# Edit an encrypted config
nix run .#secret secret/st0x-hedge.toml.age

# Re-encrypt all secrets after key changes
ragenix --rules ./infra/secrets.nix -r
```

Key access is managed via roles in `keys.nix`:

- `roles.ssh` - SSH access to the host (operator + CI)
- `roles.infra` - can decrypt terraform state (operator + CI)
- `roles.service` - can decrypt service configs (operator + host)

### Infrastructure Provisioning

Infrastructure is managed with Terraform, wrapped in Nix for reproducibility:

```bash
nix run .#tfInit     # initialize terraform
nix run .#tfPlan     # preview changes
nix run .#tfApply    # apply changes
nix run .#tfDestroy  # tear down infrastructure
```

Terraform state is encrypted with age and committed to git.

### Bootstrap (One-Time)

For initial setup of a new host, Terraform provisions a DigitalOcean Ubuntu
droplet. nixos-anywhere then converts it to NixOS over SSH:

```bash
nix run .#tfApply     # provision Ubuntu droplet
nix run .#bootstrap   # convert to NixOS (updates host key + rekeys secrets)
nix run .#deployAll   # first deployment
```

### CI/CD

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`): Builds all packages, runs tests and
  clippy inside nix derivations, builds dashboard. Runs on every push.
- **CD** (`.github/workflows/cd.yaml`): Deploys to the NixOS host via
  `nix run .#deployAll`. Runs on push to master.

To reproduce CI checks locally, use the same dev shell CI uses:

```bash
nix develop .#ci-backend -c cargo check --workspace
nix develop .#ci-backend -c cargo nextest run --workspace --all-features
nix develop .#ci-backend -c cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features
```

## Local Simulation

`nix run .#simulate` launches the full-system chaos eventual-consistency e2e
test (`full_system_concurrent`) with [mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs)
running the dashboard and bot side-by-side. Trades fire in randomized order with
delayed broker fills; between rounds the test injects chaos (bot restarts, NAV
bumps, asset add/remove, broker latency) and then asserts hedging, mint, and
USDC rebalancing still converge. Open `http://localhost:5173` to watch the
dashboard while it runs. Set `SIMULATE_EXIT_AFTER_CHAOS=1` to exit once
assertions pass instead of idling for dashboard inspection.

`nix run .#simulate-market` runs the infinite market simulation instead —
continuous user trades at ~10-second intervals. Use this when you want to
observe long-running liquidity cycling rather than a single bounded chaos
scenario.

`nix run .#simulate-14d` starts the same stack as `simulate-market`, but
preloads 14 days of seeded hedge-latency, mint, redemption, and USDC-rebalance
history so Performance tab trends and the Transfers panel are populated
immediately.

`nix run .#simulate-failures` starts the same stack as `simulate-market`, then
creates failed mint and redemption rebalances whose mock Alpaca provider later
completes and prints the `transfer recheck` commands that recover them.

What `simulate-market` does:

1. Starts a local Anvil blockchain with deployed Raindex orderbook contracts
2. Deploys mock services: Alpaca broker, tokenization API, CCTP attestation
3. Creates Raindex liquidity orders — one buy and one sell per symbol (AAPL,
   TSLA) — all sharing a single USDC vault, with per-symbol equity vaults
4. Starts the bot (hedging, equity rebalancing, USDC bridging all enabled)
5. Starts the dashboard dev server
6. Continuously takes orders at 10-second intervals, simulating users buying and
   selling tokenized equities

The `simulate-14d` variant also preloads 14 days of history -- hedge-latency
cycles, equity mints, equity redemptions, and USDC rebalances (alternating
Alpaca<->Base direction) -- before live trades begin, so the Performance tab's
percentile charts and rebalance-stage breakdown, and the dashboard's Transfers
panel, all show a trend immediately instead of waiting for historical data to
accumulate. The dashboard's default `1W` view renders the most recent week of
that seed at daily granularity; switch to `2W` to see the full 14-day history,
still at daily granularity (within ~12h of the bot starting -- the seed is a
fixed point in time, so a much longer-running session ages its oldest day out of
the `2W` window).

The bot counter-trades each fill on the mock broker, mints/redeems to rebalance
equity supply between venues, and bridges USDC via mock CCTP to keep cash
balanced. If the system works correctly, the vaults never permanently drain —
the bot cycles liquidity back through hedging and rebalancing.

Press `Ctrl-C` to stop.

## Development

### Building and Testing

```bash
cargo check                  # fast compilation check
cargo nextest run --workspace # run all tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D clippy::all
cargo fmt                    # format Rust code
nix fmt                      # format Nix code (when editing .nix files)
```

### Flake Commands

All commands are run via `nix run .#<name>`. Commands that access infrastructure
or secrets decrypt state using your SSH key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519` by default).
Pass `-i <path>` to use a different key.

**Development:**

| Command     | Usage                 | Notes                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `genBunNix` | `nix run .#genBunNix` | Regenerates `dashboard/bun.nix` from `bun.lock` |

**Building (Nix):**

| Command          | Usage                        | Notes               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `st0x-liquidity` | `nix build .#st0x-liquidity` | Build + tests       |
| `st0x-clippy`    | `nix build .#st0x-clippy`    | Clippy linting      |
| `st0x-dashboard` | `nix build .#st0x-dashboard` | SvelteKit dashboard |

**Deployment** (requires SSH key for host access and terraform state
decryption):

| Command                  | Usage                                   | Notes                                         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `prodDeployAll`          | `nix run .#prodDeployAll`               | Deploy prod system config + all services      |
| `prodDeployNixos`        | `nix run .#prodDeployNixos`             | Deploy prod NixOS system config only          |
| `prodDeployNixosBoot`    | `nix run .#prodDeployNixosBoot`         | Register prod NixOS config for next boot      |
| `prodDeployService`      | `nix run .#prodDeployService <profile>` | Deploy a single prod service                  |
| `stagingDeployAll`       | `nix run .#stagingDeployAll`            | Deploy staging system config + all services   |
| `stagingDeployNixosBoot` | `nix run .#stagingDeployNixosBoot`      | Register staging NixOS config for next boot   |
| `remote`                 | `nix run .#remote [-- <cmd>]`           | SSH into production host                      |
| `secret`                 | `nix run .#secret <file.age>`           | Edit an encrypted config, then re-encrypt all |
| `bootstrap`              | `nix run .#bootstrap`                   | One-time NixOS install on a new host          |

The deploy workflows also expose a `broker-migration` mode for the one-time
`dbus` to `dbus-broker` migration. Use that mode when a NixOS change must be
registered for next boot instead of live-switched: it boot-deploys the system
profile, reboots the host, waits for SSH over Tailscale, verifies `dbus-broker`,
then runs the normal full deploy to reactivate service profiles. This keeps the
host on the current NixOS default instead of carrying a permanent override back
to classic `dbus`.

To run the production migration:

1. Draft the release tag from `master`.
2. Open the **Deploy to Production** GitHub Actions workflow.
3. Click **Run workflow**.
4. Enter the release tag.
5. Set `mode` to `broker-migration`.
6. Start the workflow and wait for the final `Deploy all profiles after reboot`
   step to pass.
7. Use the default `all` mode for future production deploys.

**Infrastructure** (requires SSH key for terraform state decryption):

| Command      | Usage                  | Notes                             |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `tfInit`     | `nix run .#tfInit`     | Initialize terraform              |
| `tfPlan`     | `nix run .#tfPlan`     | Preview infrastructure changes    |
| `tfApply`    | `nix run .#tfApply`    | Apply planned changes             |
| `tfDestroy`  | `nix run .#tfDestroy`  | Tear down infrastructure          |
| `tfEditVars` | `nix run .#tfEditVars` | Edit terraform vars in `$EDITOR`  |
| `tfRekey`    | `nix run .#tfRekey`    | Re-encrypt terraform state + vars |
| `resolveIp`  | `nix run .#resolveIp`  | Print the production host IP      |

### Dashboard Dependencies

After changing `dashboard/bun.lock`, regenerate and format the Nix lockfile:

```bash
nix run .#genBunNix
nix fmt -- dashboard/bun.nix
```

CI will fail if `bun.nix` is out of sync with `bun.lock`.

## How It Works

**Market Making Flow:**

1. **Provide Liquidity**: Raindex orders offer continuous two-sided liquidity
   for tokenized equities at spreads around oracle prices
2. **Detect Fills**: WebSocket monitors orderbook events when traders take
   liquidity onchain
3. **Parse Trade**: Extract details (symbol, amount, direction, price) from
   blockchain events
4. **Accumulate**: Batch positions until the configured execution threshold is
   reached (typically dollar-based for Alpaca Broker API, whole-share for
   `dry-run`)
5. **Hedge**: Execute offsetting market order on traditional brokerage to reduce
   exposure
6. **Track**: Maintain complete audit trail linking onchain fills to offchain
   hedges

**Profit Model**: The system earns the spread on each trade (difference between
onchain order price and offchain hedge execution price) while hedging
directional exposure.

**Note**: Alpaca Broker API supports fractional share execution and the bot can
hedge using dollar-value thresholds. `dry-run` remains available for local
testing with whole-share thresholds when that is operationally useful.

//! Apalis jobs that drive tokenized equity transfers through their
//! lifecycles, one per direction: [`TransferEquityToMarketMaking`] for mints
//! (`TokenizedEquityMint`) and [`TransferEquityToHedging`] for redemptions
//! (`EquityRedemption`).
//!
//! Each job is keyed by an aggregate id chosen at enqueue time, so apalis
//! retries (and bot restarts that re-pick the row from the Jobs table) hit
//! the same aggregate. The worker calls the trait-erased resume entry point
//! on the equity transfer, which loads the aggregate via `Store::load` and
//! dispatches on its current state: an absent aggregate starts a fresh
//! transfer, an in-flight one resumes from its persisted step, and a terminal
//! one is a no-op. New transfers and mid-flight resumes share the same entry
//! point -- that uniformity is what makes recovery dispatch fall out of the
//! standard transfer lifecycle.
//!
//! The per-symbol `equity_in_progress` guard is cleared event-driven when the
//! aggregate reaches a terminal state (success or a recorded failure), not by
//! these workers. A transient failure that only schedules a retry keeps the
//! guard latched so automation does not re-arm a fresh transfer on top of a
//! partial one.

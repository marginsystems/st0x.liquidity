//! Apalis jobs that drive USDC transfers through the `UsdcRebalance`
//! lifecycle, one per direction.
//!
//! Each job is keyed by a `UsdcRebalanceId` chosen at enqueue time, so apalis
//! retries (and bot restarts that re-pick the row from the Jobs table) hit
//! the same aggregate. The worker calls the trait-erased `resume_*` entry
//! point on the cash transfer, which loads the aggregate via `Store::load`
//! and dispatches on its current state. New transfers and mid-flight resumes
//! share the same entry point — that uniformity is what makes recovery
//! dispatch fall out of the standard transfer lifecycle.
//!
//! The global `usdc_in_progress` guard is cleared event-driven when the
//! aggregate reaches a terminal state (success or a recorded failure), not by
//! this worker. A transient failure that only schedules a retry, or an
//! indeterminate failure that leaves the aggregate mid-flight (e.g. stalled at
//! `WithdrawalSubmitting`/`BridgingSubmitting`), keeps the guard latched so
//! automation does not re-arm a fresh transfer on top of a partial one.

//! USDC cross-venue transfers between Alpaca and Base.
//!
//! [`CrossVenueCashTransfer`] drives USDC transfers in both directions through
//! direct `execute_alpaca_to_base` / `execute_base_to_alpaca` entry points,
//! with matching `resume_*` paths for apalis-driven crash recovery. Each
//! transfer handles USD/USDC conversion, withdrawal, CCTP bridging, and deposit.

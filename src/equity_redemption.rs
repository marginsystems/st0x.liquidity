//! Aggregate modeling the lifecycle of redeeming tokenized
//! equities for underlying shares.
//!
//! Tracks the workflow from withdrawing tokens from the Raindex vault
//! through sending to Alpaca's redemption wallet to share delivery.
//!
//! # State Flow
//!
//! The aggregate progresses through the following states:
//!
//! ```text
//!     Redeem ------------> Failed
//!       |
//!       v
//!     WithdrawnFromRaindex --> Failed
//!       |
//!       v
//!     TokensUnwrapped ------> Failed
//!       |
//!       v
//!     TokensSent ------------> Failed
//!       |
//!       v
//!     Pending ---------------> Failed
//!       |
//!       v
//!     Completed
//! ```
//!
//! - `Redeem` withdraws wrapped tokens from the Raindex vault
//! - `WithdrawnFromRaindex` tracks tokens withdrawn, awaiting unwrap
//! - `UnwrapTokens` unwraps ERC-4626 shares into underlying tokens
//! - `TokensUnwrapped` tracks unwrapped tokens, ready to send
//! - `TokensSent` tracks tokens sent to Alpaca's redemption wallet
//! - `Pending` indicates Alpaca detected the transfer
//! - `Completed` and `Failed` are terminal states
//!
//! # Services
//!
//! The aggregate uses cqrs-es Services (`RedemptionServices`) with `Tokenizer` and `Vault`
//! traits to execute side effects atomically:
//!
//! - `vault.withdraw()` - Withdraws tokens from Rain OrderBook vault
//! - `tokenizer.send_for_redemption()` - Sends tokens to Alpaca's redemption wallet
//!
//! This pattern ensures that if Raindex withdraw succeeds but send fails, the aggregate stays
//! in `WithdrawnFromRaindex` state (tokens in wallet, not stranded).
//!
//! # Error Handling
//!
//! The aggregate enforces strict state transitions:
//!
//! - Commands that don't match current state return appropriate errors
//! - Terminal states (Completed, Failed) reject all state-changing commands
//! - Failed state preserves context depending on when failure occurred
//! - All state transitions are captured as events for complete audit trail

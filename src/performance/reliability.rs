//! Reliability read models: lifecycle failure events, log volume
//! aggregation, and job queue health.
//!
//! Distinguishes money-at-risk failures (failed hedges, failed rebalance
//! stages) recorded as CQRS events from cosmetic log noise, and surfaces
//! apalis queue backlogs and retry pressure.
//!
//! Lifecycle failure events are maintained by [`LifecycleFailureProjection`],
//! which subscribes to the `OffchainOrder`, `UsdcRebalance`, `EquityRedemption`,
//! and `TokenizedEquityMint` event streams and records one row per failure event
//! into `lifecycle_failure_event`. [`load_failure_events`] reads ONLY that table
//! and never folds the `events` table. The log-aggregation and job-queue-health
//! read paths read their own sources (structured logs, the apalis `Jobs` table)
//! and are left untouched.
//!
//! Checkpointed catch-up: [`LifecycleFailureProjection::catch_up`] runs at
//! startup, before the live reactor consumes events, replaying every failure
//! across all four streams past each aggregate's persisted checkpoint
//! (`lifecycle_failure_checkpoint`). The live reactor is forward-only WHILE
//! running, but an event it drops (a crash between an event being persisted and
//! this table being updated) is replayed on the next startup -- so the read
//! model converges on the event log instead of staying best-effort until someone
//! rebuilds.
//!
//! Rebuildable: each failure row is a pure function of an event payload (the
//! mappers read the event's own `failed_at`/`timed_out_at`, never a
//! processing-time clock) and is written with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` on its
//! `(aggregate_type, aggregate_id, event_type, occurred_at)` identity, so
//! replaying the log reproduces the exact rows live processing produced -- no
//! duplicates. The live reactor has no access to the event `sequence` (the
//! `Reactor` trait only passes the domain event), so the dedup key is that
//! identity tuple rather than the sequence, and the checkpoint advances only on
//! the replay/catch-up path. [`LifecycleFailureProjection::rebuild_all`]
//! truncates both tables and re-folds every stream. That replay-equals-live
//! property is what makes this a valid CQRS/ES projection: the event log stays
//! the single source of truth.
